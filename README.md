# ISO-Explorer

This website tries to connect publicly available questions related to C++ from StackOverflow.com with the corresponding paragraphs in the ISO C++ drafts. At the moment this project supports the drafts n3337, n4140 and n4659, but more are planned to be added. I mainly created this project as a test pilot in an effort trying to read and understand the standard better. The code of this project is not in an excelling shape since it is the result of fast prototyping combined with my insufficient web development skills. However, since the project proves to be useful as a learning resource for myself already I would like to share it with the public hoping that somebody might benefit from it. Lastly I need to mention that I don't own any interlectual property rights but instead this tool leverages the incredible value of the publicly available datasets from StackOverflow.com and isocpp.org.

There are many open tasks and a lot of room for improvements. Mainly I want to focus on these points in the future and invite everybody to help me out with it
* Including all cpp drafts
* Full-text search
* Favorites
* Resizable panels
* Link from draft to questions
* Highlight text in drafts
* Button to report broken links

Lastly I expect you to find quirks, rendering issues or incorrectly linked paragraphs. If you see any of those please open an issue on this project. I tested the page with Chromium 64.0.3282.167 and Firefox 59.0.1.
