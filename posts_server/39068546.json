The output of the test\n  case reflects this order.</p>\n<p id=\"so_39068546_39068642_1\">The order of initialization (and destruction) of std:stuple subobjects\n  is less clearly specified.  At least it's not immediately obvious from\n  my reading of the spec if any particular order is required.</p>\n<p id=\"so_39068546_39068642_2\">The reason why the output for std::tuple with libstdc++ is the reverse\n  of std::pair is because the implementation, which relies on recursive\n  inheritance,  stores and constructs tuple elements in the reverse\n  order: i.e., the base class, which stores the last element, is stored\n  and constructed first, followed by each derived class (each of which\n  stores the last - Nth element).</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>The quote from standard [section 20.4.1] which the bug reporter is quoting to</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p id=\"so_39068546_39068642_3\">1 This subclause describes the tuple library that provides a tuple\n  type as the class template tuple that can be instantiated with any\n  number of arguments. Each template argument specifies the type of an\n  element in the tuple. Consequently, tuples are heterogeneous,\n  fixed-size collections of values. <strong>An instantiation of tuple with two\n  arguments is similar to an instantiation of pair with the same two\n  arguments</strong>. See 20.3.</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>Argument against this made in the linked bug is:</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p id=\"so_39068546_39068642_4\">Being described as similar doesn't imply they are identical in every\n  detail.  std::pair and std::tuple are distinct classes with different\n  requirements on each.  If you believe the are required to behave\n  identically in this respect (i.e., have their subobjects defined in\n  the same order) you need to point to the specific wording that\n  guarantees it.</p>\n</blockquote>\n", "LastEditorUserId": "434233", "LastActivityDate": "2016-08-21T21:09:43.973", "Score": "13", "CreationDate": "2016-08-21T20:37:26.360", "ParentId": "39068546", "CommentCount": "9", "OwnerUserId": "434233", "LastEditDate": "2016-08-21T21:09:43.973"}, "39068874": {"Id": "39068874", "PostTypeId": "2", "Body": "<p>The standard doesn't specify the order of destruction for <code>std::tuple</code>.
