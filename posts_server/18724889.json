In this case, it points to a string literal, which is an array with a lifetime as long as the program. So this usage is safe.</p>\n<p>If it were to point to an array that might be destroyed while the pointer were still in use, then it would not be safe.</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p id=\"so_18724889_18724984_1\">Is the memory allocated for the storage of the string freed when the string goes out of scope?</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>No; the pointer will not manage memory for you.
