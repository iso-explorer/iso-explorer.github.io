I want to design a dynamic array class in 2D (think of a std::vector kind of a container but in 2D instead of 1D). A straightforward approach would be:</p>\n<pre><code>template &lt;typename T&gt;\nclass Array2D&lt;T&gt; {\nprivate:\n    T* data_;\n    int nb_rows_;\n    int nb_columns_;\npublic:\n    ...\n};\n</code></pre>\n<p>Unfortunately, this design is not SIMD friendly as a loop such as</p>\n<pre><code>Array2D&lt;int&gt; A(5, 6);\nfor (int i = 0; i &lt; A.nb_rows(); ++i) {\n    for (int j = 0; j &lt; A.nb_columns(); ++j) {\n        A(i, j) += 1;\n    }\n}\n</code></pre>\n<p>would fail to vectorize as the compiler can't be sure if nb_columns_ is not changed during the loop because of pointer aliasing. Therefore, I use the same design as most implementation of std::vector where the size of the vector is \"hidden\" in a pointer.</p>\n<pre><code>template &lt;typename T&gt;\nclass Array2D&lt;T&gt; {\nprivate:\n    T* data_;\n    T* nb_rows_;\n    T* nb_columns_;\npublic:\n    Array2D(int n, int p) {\n        data_ = new T[n * p];\n        nb_rows_ = data_ + n;\n        nb_columns_ = data_ + p;\n    }\n    ...\n    int nb_columns() const {\n        return static_cast&lt;int&gt;(nb_columns_ - data_);\n    }\n    ...\n};\n</code></pre>\n<p>This design works well as long as n &gt;= 1 and p &gt;= 1. But if n = 0 and p = 5, you end up with the kind of \"problem\" explained above. Constructing an Array2D with 0 rows might be useful because of the following method in my class</p>\n<pre><code>void push_back(const Array1D&lt;T&gt;&amp; B);\n</code></pre>\n<p>that takes an Array1D of size p (it is checked with an assert) and adds a row to my Array2D object. You could do:</p>\n<pre><code>Array2D&lt;double&gt; A(0, 10);\nArray1D&lt;double&gt; B(10);\n\n// work with B\nA.push_back(B);\n</code></pre>\n<p>The code works fine on clang, g++ and icpc but I am still wondering if it is valid. Section 5.7 of the C++11 standard is about that problem but talk about \"array objects\". I am wondering if my p points to what they call an \"array object\", or if an array object is something such as \"double p[5]\".</p>\n", "Tags": "<c++><arrays><language-lawyer>", "OwnerUserId": "3763545", "AnswerCount": "2"}, "bq_ids": {"n4140": {"so_26626663_26627045_0": {"section_id": 6142, "quality": 0.9814814814814815, "length": 106}, "so_26626663_26627168_2": {"section_id": 6141, "quality": 0.9473684210526315, "length": 18}, "so_26626663_26627168_0": {"section_id": 6142, "quality": 1.0, "length": 32}, "so_26626663_26627168_1": {"section_id": 7223, "quality": 0.5714285714285714, "length": 4}}, "n3337": {"so_26626663_26627045_0": {"section_id": 5906, "quality": 0.9814814814814815, "length": 106}, "so_26626663_26627168_2": {"section_id": 5905, "quality": 0.9473684210526315, "length": 18}, "so_26626663_26627168_0": {"section_id": 5906, "quality": 1.0, "length": 32}, "so_26626663_26627168_1": {"section_id": 6967, "quality": 0.5714285714285714, "length": 4}}, "n4659": {"so_26626663_26627168_0": {"section_id": 7638, "quality": 0.625, "length": 20}, "so_26626663_26627168_2": {"section_id": 7603, "quality": 0.5789473684210527, "length": 11}}}, "26627045": {"ParentId": "26626663", "PostTypeId": "2", "CommentCount": "7", "Body": "<p>It's undefined behavior.
