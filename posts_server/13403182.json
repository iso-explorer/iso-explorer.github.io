These rules are hardwired into the language syntax.</p>\n<p>The C++ standard says (\u00a713.5.6, emphasis mine):</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p id=\"so_13403182_13403216_0\">An operator function shall either be a non-static member function or be a non-member function and have\n  at least one parameter whose type is a class, a reference to a class, an enumeration, or a reference to an\n  enumeration. <strong>It is not possible to change the precedence, grouping, or number of operands of operators.</strong>\n  The meaning of the operators =, (unary) &amp;, and , (comma), prede\ufb01ned for each type, can be changed [...]</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>Not only is the <code>^</code> operator left-associative, but <a href=\"http://en.cppreference.com/w/cpp/language/operator_precedence\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">it also has a very low precedence</a>. The correct precedence for a power operator should be higher than the multiplication (so priority 4 or better on this table), but it has priority 10--this means that even additions and subtractions are evaluated before it. <code>1 + 2 ^ 3 * 4</code> will be parsed as <code>(1 + 2) ^ (3 * 4)</code>, while a mathematically correct power operator should parse as <code>1 + (2 ^ 3) * 4</code>.</p>\n<p>If the associativity or priority of an operator could be modified, a huge, huge syntactical mess would ensue. My humble opinion is that you should not try to overload the <code>^</code> operator to use it as a power operator.
