This means (for example) that an <code>int</code> can contain an extra bit (or more than one) to signify whether it has been initialized or not.</p>\n<p>If you try to read an <code>int</code> with that bit saying it hasn't been initialized, it can trigger some sort of trap/exception/fault that (for example) immediately shuts down your program with some sort of error message. Any time you <em>write</em> a value to the <code>int</code>, that trap representation is cleared, so reading from it can/will work.</p>\n<p>So basically, when your program starts, it initializes <em>all</em> your <code>int</code>s to such trap representations. If you try to read from an uninitialized variable, the hardware will catch it immediately and give you an error message.</p>\n<p>The standard mandates that for <code>unsigned char</code>, no such trap representation is possible--all the bits of an <code>unsigned char</code> must be \"visible\"--they must form part of the value. That means none of them can be hidden; <em>no</em> pattern of bits you put into an <code>unsigned char</code> can form a trap representation (or anything similar). Any bits you put into <code>unsigned char</code> must simply form some value.</p>\n<p>Any other type, however, <em>can</em> have trap representations. If, for example, you take some (more or less) arbitrarily chosen 8 bits out of some other type, and read them as an <code>unsigned char</code>, they'll always form a value you can read, write to a file, etc. If, however, you attempt to read them as <em>any</em> other type (<code>signed char</code>, <code>unsigned int</code>, etc.) it's allowable for it to form a trap representation, and attempting to do <em>anything</em> with it can give undefined behavior.</p>\n", "LastActivityDate": "2014-10-08T04:47:52.620", "Score": "1", "CreationDate": "2014-10-08T04:47:52.620", "ParentId": "26249221", "CommentCount": "0", "OwnerUserId": "179910"}, "26249221": {"ViewCount": "71", "Body": "<p><code>N3797::3.9.1/1  [basic.fundamental]</code> says</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p id=\"so_26249221_26249221_0\">For <em>unsigned</em> narrow character types, all possible bit patterns of the\n  value representation represent numbers.</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>That's a bit unclear for me.
