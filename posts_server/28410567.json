If the expression is an rvalue, then the move constructor will be picked by overload resolution (assuming a move constructor is present).</p>\n<p>Now although it is true that the expression <code>x</code> in the <code>return x;</code> statement is an lvalue (which may lead you to think that what I just wrote does not apply), in situations where a named object with automatic storage duration is returned, the compiler shall first try to treat the <em>id-expression</em> as an rvalue for overload resolution.</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p id=\"so_28410567_28410620_1\">What is the relevant clause in the standard?
