In your example, there is no relationship between <code>A</code> and <code>B</code>, so there is no reason for you to even try to define the constructor in another class. The only reason that you would want to mention the constructor of <code>A</code> in <code>B</code> is if <code>B</code> is derived from <code>A</code>. You want to keep parts of <code>A</code> with <code>A</code>, not separate them into other classes and make it a nightmare for readability and maintenance. The short version is that you should keep all parts of <code>A</code> with <code>A</code>, so don't try to put them somewhere else. </p>\n", "LastActivityDate": "2018-02-28T05:27:24.353", "Score": "0", "CreationDate": "2018-02-28T05:27:24.353", "ParentId": "49019730", "CommentCount": "0", "OwnerUserId": "9277550"}, "bq_ids": {"n4140": {"so_49019730_49024131_0": {"length": 38, "quality": 1.0, "section_id": 5881}}, "n3337": {"so_49019730_49024131_0": {"length": 38, "quality": 1.0, "section_id": 5652}}, "n4659": {"so_49019730_49024131_0": {"length": 38, "quality": 1.0, "section_id": 7364}}}});
