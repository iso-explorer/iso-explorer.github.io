The first context is when a default constructor is called to initialize an element of an array. If the constructor has one or more default arguments, the destruction of every temporary created in a default argument is sequenced before the construction of the next array element, if any.</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>and</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p id=\"so_6315670_6315670_1\">The second context is when a reference is bound to a temporary. The temporary to which the reference is bound or the temporary that is the complete object of a subobject to which the reference is bound persists for the lifetime of the reference except:\n  [...]</p>\n<ul>\n<li>A temporary bound to a reference parameter in a function call (5.2.2) persists until the completion of the full-expression containing the call.</li>\n</ul>\n</blockquote>\n<p>These two two seem to contradict for the following case</p>\n<pre><code>struct A {\n  A() { std::cout &lt;&lt; \"C\" &lt;&lt; std::endl; }\n  ~A() { std::cout &lt;&lt; \"D\" &lt;&lt; std::endl; }\n};\n\nstruct B {\n  B(A const&amp; a = A()) { }\n};\n\ntypedef B array[2];\n\nint main() {\n  array{};\n}\n</code></pre>\n<p>Will this output <code>CDCD</code> as required by the first context, or will this output <code>CCDD</code> as required by the second context?
