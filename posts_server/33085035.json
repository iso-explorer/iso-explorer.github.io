It uses a leading <code>0</code> for octal, or a leading <code>0x</code> or <code>0X</code> for hexadecimal; otherwise, it's assumed to be decimal. With <code>base==10</code>, it doesn't recognize anything other than decimal (which is more user-friendly; most uses won't expect an input of <code>010</code> to be interpreted as <code>8</code>).</p>\n<p>Floating-point numbers can be represented in bases other than decimal, but C++ only supports decimal.
