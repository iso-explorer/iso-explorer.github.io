So that argument and parameter lists are comparable within this heterogeneous set, a member function is considered to have an extra parameter, called the <em>implicit object parameter</em>, which represents the object for which the member function has been called. For the purposes of overload resolution, both static and non-static member functions have an implicit object parameter, but constructors do not.</p>\n<p id=\"so_19276238_19276546_1\">Similarly, when appropriate, the context can construct an argument list that contains an <em>implied object argument</em> to denote the object to be operated on. Since arguments and parameters are associated by position within their respective lists, the convention is that the implicit object parameter, if present, is always the first parameter and the implied object argument, if present, is always the first argument.</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>and</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p id=\"so_19276238_19276546_2\">During overload resolution, the implied object argument is indistinguishable from other arguments.
