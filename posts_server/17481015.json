Switching between modes was possible, but fairly slow. At the same time, execution in double precision mode was almost as fast as in single precision mode (if memory serves, even faster in a few cases).</p>\n<p>Second, early C didn't have a way to specify function parameter types. The standard library functions only accepted double precision floating point (since it gave extra precision almost for free). Writing the library to deal with both single and double precision floating point would have (approximately) doubled the effort, but provided little real advantage.</p>\n", "OwnerUserId": "179910", "PostTypeId": "2", "Id": "17481727", "Score": "3", "CreationDate": "2013-07-05T05:34:02.210", "LastActivityDate": "2013-07-05T05:34:02.210"}, "17481015": {"CommentCount": "2", "ViewCount": "227", "PostTypeId": "1", "LastEditorUserId": "2260356", "CreationDate": "2013-07-05T04:21:18.353", "LastActivityDate": "2013-07-05T06:09:33.070", "Title": "double prefered over float at constructortion", "AcceptedAnswerId": "17481021", "LastEditDate": "2013-07-05T04:27:13.110", "Id": "17481015", "Score": "2", "Body": "<p>Please explain:</p>\n<p>I'm declaring a class with 2 constructors as following:</p>\n<pre><code>class A {\npublic :\n  A (double x) {cout &lt;&lt; \"DOUBLE \\n\";}\n  A (float x) {cout &lt;&lt; \"FLOAT \\n\";}\n};\n</code></pre>\n<p>Then:</p>\n<pre><code>A a (3.7);\n</code></pre>\n<p>This result with <em>DOUBLE</em> as output.\nI've tried this also on java - same result.\nCan anyone explain why?</p>\n<p>EDIT: I do realise double is the default type for number such as <em>3.7</em> My question is why and if there is a good reason for that.</p>\n", "Tags": "<java><c++><constructor><double>", "OwnerUserId": "2260356", "AnswerCount": "4"}, "17481028": {"ParentId": "17481015", "CommentCount": "2", "Body": "<p>By default 3.7 will be considered as <code>double</code> in java.
