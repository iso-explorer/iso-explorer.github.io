It merges identical functions into a single instance. You can disable it by adding the following switch to the linker commandline: <code>/OPT:NOICF</code>   (from the Visual Studio UI it is found under <em>Properties-&gt;Linker-&gt;Optimization-&gt;Enable COMDAT Folding</em>)</p>\n<p>You can find details at the MSDN article here: <a href=\"http://msdn.microsoft.com/en-us/library/bxwfs976%28v=vs.110%29.aspx\">/OPT (Optimizations)</a></p>\n<p>The switch is a linker-stage switch, which means you won't be able to enable it just for a specific module or a specific region of code (such as <code>__pragma( optimize() )</code> which is available for compiler-stage optimization).</p>\n<p>In general, however, it is considered poor practice to rely on either function pointers or literal string pointers (<code>const char*</code>) for testing uniqueness.  String folding is widely implemented by almost all C/C++ compilers.  Function folding is only available on Visual C++ at this time, though increased widespread use of template&lt;&gt; meta-programming has increased requests for this feature to be added to gcc and clang toolchains.</p>\n<p>Edit: Starting with binutils 2.19, the included gold linker supposedly also supports ICF, though I have been unable to verify it on my local Ubuntu 12.10 install.</p>\n", "OwnerUserId": "786437", "LastEditorUserId": "786437", "LastEditDate": "2013-01-07T14:16:37.897", "Id": "14184695", "Score": "27", "CreationDate": "2013-01-06T17:22:32.293", "LastActivityDate": "2013-01-07T14:16:37.897"}, "14176510": {"ParentId": "14176320", "CommentCount": "10", "Body": "<p>C++11 5.3.1 describes what <code>&amp;</code> does; in this instance, it gives you a pointer to the member function in question, and the passage makes no requirement that this pointer must be unique.</p>\n<p>However, 5.10/1 says about <code>==</code>:</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p id=\"so_14176320_14176510_0\">Two pointers of the same type compare equal if and only if they are both null, both point to the same function, or both represent the same address.</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>The question then becomes... are <code>test1</code> and <code>test2</code> \"the same function\"?</p>\n<p>Though the optimizer has collapsed them into a single definition, arguably the two names identify two functions and, as such, <strong>this would seem to be an implementation bug</strong>.</p>\n<p>(Note, though, that the VS team don't care and consider it \"valid enough\" to warrant the benefits of the optimisation.
