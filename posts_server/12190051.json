Now i'm trying the same thing with code that looks like this:</p>\n<p>hpp:</p>\n<pre><code>class Tokenizer\n{\npublic:\n  Tokenizer();\n  Tokenizer(std::stringstream *lines);\n  virtual ~Tokenizer() {};\nprivate:\n  std::stringstream *lines;\n};\n</code></pre>\n<p>cpp:</p>\n<pre><code>Tokenizer::Tokenizer()\n  : expected('=')\n{\n}\n\nTokenizer::Tokenizer(std::stringstream *lines)\n  : Tokenizer(),\n    lines(lines)\n{\n}\n</code></pre>\n<p>But this is giving me the error: \n<code>In constructor \u2018config::Tokenizer::Tokenizer(std::stringstream*)\u2019:\n/path/Tokenizer.cpp:14:20: error: mem-initializer for \u2018config::Tokenizer::lines\u2019 follows constructor delegation</code> I've tried moving the Tokenizer() part first and last in the list but that didn't help.</p>\n<p>What's the reason behind this and how should i fix it? I've tried moving the <code>lines(lines)</code> to the body with <code>this-&gt;lines = lines;</code> instead and it works fine. But i would really like to be able to use the initializer list.</p>\n<p>Thanks in advance!</p>\n", "AcceptedAnswerId": "12190126", "Title": "Member initialization while using delegated constructor", "CreationDate": "2012-08-30T04:46:02.870", "Id": "12190051", "CommentCount": "0", "FavoriteCount": "5", "PostTypeId": "1", "LastEditDate": "2017-05-23T10:31:30.387", "LastEditorUserId": "-1", "LastActivityDate": "2014-03-26T20:43:08.877", "Score": "55", "OwnerUserId": "1055398", "Tags": "<c++><gcc><c++11><ctor-initializer>", "AnswerCount": "1"}, "12190126": {"Id": "12190126", "PostTypeId": "2", "Body": "<p>When you delegate the member initialization to another constructor, there is an assumption that the other constructor initializes the object <em>completely</em>, including all members (i.e. including the <code>lines</code> member in your example).

If a mem-initializer-id designates the constructor\u2019s class, <strong>it shall be the only mem-initializer</strong>; the constructor is a delegating constructor, and the constructor selected by the  is the target constructor.
