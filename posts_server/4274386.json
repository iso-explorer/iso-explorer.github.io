This is an interesting show of how templates can change meaning of code in subtle ways.

It says that too there</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p id=\"so_4274386_4279182_1\">When looking for a prior declaration of a class or a function declared as a friend, and when the name of the friend class or function is neither a qualified name nor a template-id, scopes outside the innermost enclosing namespace scope are not considered.</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>The lookup for \"class b\" is delegated from 7.1.5.3/2 to 3.4.4 which in turn delegates to unqualified name lookup at 3.4/7. All the question now is whether the template-name \"b\" is visible in the friend declaration class a. If it isn't, the name is not found and the friend declaration will refer to a new declared class at global scope. 3.3.6/1 about the scope of it says</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p id=\"so_4274386_4279182_2\">The potential scope of a name declared in a class consists not only of the declarative region following\n  the name\u2019s declarator, but also of all function bodies, default arguments, and constructor ctor-\n  initializers in that class (including such things in nested classes).</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>Ignoring a few pedantic points that would make this wording not apply to here (which were a defect but are fixed in the C++0x version of that paragraph which also makes this easier to read), this list does not include the friend declaration as an area where that template name is visible. </p>\n<p><strong>However</strong>, the friend was declared in a member class of a class template. When the member class is instantiated <em>different</em> lookup applies - the lookup for friend names declared in a class template! The Standard says</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p id=\"so_4274386_4279182_3\">Friend classes or functions can be declared within a class template. When a template is instantiated, the\n  names of its friends are treated as if the specialization had been explicitly declared at its point of instantiation.</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>So the following code is invalid:</p>\n<pre><code>template&lt;typename T&gt;\nclass List\n{\npublic:\n    class a {\n        typedef int type;\n        friend class b; // that's fine!\n    };\n\n    template &lt;typename U &gt; class b;\n};\n\n// POI\nList&lt;int&gt;::a x; \n</code></pre>\n<p>When that causes <code>List&lt;int&gt;::a</code> to be implicitly instantiated, the name <code>a</code> is looked up at \"// POI\" as if there would have been an explicit specialization declared. In that case, the template <code>List::b</code> has already been declared, and this lookup will hit it and emit an error because it's a template and not a non-template class. </p>\n", "OwnerUserId": "34509", "LastEditorUserId": "34509", "LastEditDate": "2010-11-26T12:15:29.953", "Id": "4279182", "Score": "6", "CreationDate": "2010-11-25T16:37:34.887", "LastActivityDate": "2010-11-26T12:15:29.953"}, "4274471": {"ParentId": "4274386", "CommentCount": "0", "Body": "<p>//Run this- it now will compile for you</p>\n<pre><code>template &lt;typename U &gt; class b; //&lt;----- forward declaration\n\ntemplate&lt;typename T&gt;\nclass List\n{\nprotected:\n\n\n        class a {\n        int x;\n        int y;\n        private:\n          friend class b&lt;T&gt;;  // &lt;------------ Add &lt;T&gt;\n        };\n        template &lt;typename U &gt; class b { \n          int z;\n          U y;\n        };\n\n        public:\n        List() {\n          a* ptr = (a *)new unsigned char[sizeof(a)];\n        }\n};\n\nint main() {\n    List&lt;int&gt;  mylist;\n\n}\n</code></pre>\n", "OwnerUserId": "505931", "PostTypeId": "2", "Id": "4274471", "Score": "3", "CreationDate": "2010-11-25T07:02:06.407", "LastActivityDate": "2010-11-25T07:02:06.407"}});
