In C++, when an object is thrown it is first copied to a temporary object, and the temporary object is then passed to the catching code. The copy involves the use of the object's class copy constructor. AFAIK, this means that if a class has a private copy constructor, it can't be used as an exception. However, in VS2010, the following code compiles and runs:</p>\n<pre><code>class Except\n{\n    Except(const Except&amp; other) { i = 2; }\npublic:\n    int i;\n    Except() : i(1) {}\n};\n\nint main()\n{\n    try\n    {\n        Except ex1;\n        throw ex1;          // private copy constructor is invoked\n    }\n    catch (Except&amp; ex2)\n    {\n        assert(ex2.i == 2); // assert doesn't yell - ex2.i is indeed 2\n    }\n    return 0;\n}\n</code></pre>\n<p>Is this legal?</p>\n", "Tags": "<c++><visual-studio-2010><exception><private><copy-constructor>", "OwnerUserId": "26039", "AnswerCount": "2"}});
