This choice for sizes has more to do with the old 16-bit times than with unsigned-ness and it was in my opinion a terrible choice that we're still paying as bugs.</p>\n", "LastActivityDate": "2010-06-12T20:05:38.633", "CommentCount": "4", "CreationDate": "2010-06-12T20:05:38.633", "ParentId": "3029412", "Score": "0", "OwnerUserId": "320726"}, "6640936": {"Id": "6640936", "PostTypeId": "2", "Body": "<blockquote>\n<p id=\"so_3029412_6640936_0\">But I think C++ must provide it.</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>Why?
