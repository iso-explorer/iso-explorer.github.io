This includes code that will run in destructors for any objects allocated on the stack that are still alive.</li>\n<li>You must be absolutely 100% positively sure that no one even touches the this pointer itself after the delete this line. In other words, you must not examine it, compare it with another pointer, compare it with nullptr, print it, cast it, do anything with it.</li>\n</ol>\n</blockquote>\n<p>Since your code abides those rules, again, it's fine.</p>\n", "LastActivityDate": "2015-10-14T07:57:29.917"}, "33119348": {"CommentCount": "7", "ViewCount": "57", "ClosedDate": "2015-10-14T07:44:19.510", "CreationDate": "2015-10-14T07:37:09.727", "LastActivityDate": "2015-10-14T07:57:29.917", "Title": "Behaviour of `delete this` in a function", "PostTypeId": "1", "Id": "33119348", "Score": "2", "Body": "<p>Suppose I have a class <code>foo</code> with a function <code>release</code> that calls <code>delete this</code>:</p>\n<pre><code>struct foo\n{\n    std::int32_t release() const\n    {\n        delete this;\n        return 0;\n    }\n};\n</code></pre>\n<ol>\n<li><p>Why can I even call <code>delete this</code> given that the function is <code>const</code>?</p></li>\n<li><p>Is the behaviour on returning 0 defined?
