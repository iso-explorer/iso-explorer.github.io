I'm not sure the last sentence of the quote is the necessary condition to be an object. Literals are neither created by a definition nor by a new-expression, but all literals except string literals are temporary objects, right? That leads to the strange conclusion that string literals are not objects while all other literals are objects. This feels wrong.</p>\n", "Tags": "<c++><object><literals>", "OwnerUserId": "615789", "AnswerCount": "1"}, "bq_ids": {"n4140": {"so_28795540_28795540_0": {"section_id": 5790, "quality": 0.7391304347826086, "length": 17}}, "n3337": {"so_28795540_28795540_0": {"section_id": 5563, "quality": 0.7391304347826086, "length": 17}}, "n4659": {"so_28795540_28795540_0": {"section_id": 7247, "quality": 0.6086956521739131, "length": 14}}}});
