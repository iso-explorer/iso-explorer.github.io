If the return type is int, you've just got yourself a garbage value, but for strings you have a garbage value that's meant to point (directly or indirectly) to the heap memory used by the string to store the textual value and possibly some reference counter or other management data.  Later in the program, the calling code will try to deallocate that heap memory by deleting the pointer.  Deleting a pointer with a garbage value's quite likely to crash your program.</p>\n", "LastActivityDate": "2012-06-19T07:34:41.963", "Id": "11096402", "CommentCount": "0", "CreationDate": "2012-06-19T07:34:41.963", "ParentId": "11096027", "Score": "5", "OwnerUserId": "410767"}, "bq_ids": {"n4140": {"so_11096027_11096091_0": {"length": 54, "quality": 0.9310344827586207, "section_id": 3913}}, "n3337": {"so_11096027_11096091_0": {"length": 54, "quality": 0.9310344827586207, "section_id": 3773}}}, "11096060": {"PostTypeId": "2", "Body": "<p>Both are undefined behaviors, even <code>noCrash</code> can crash.</p>\n", "LastActivityDate": "2012-06-19T07:12:22.417", "Id": "11096060", "CommentCount": "0", "CreationDate": "2012-06-19T07:12:22.417", "ParentId": "11096027", "Score": "7", "OwnerUserId": "392315"}, "11096091": {"PostTypeId": "2", "Body": "<p>From standard 6.6.3/2</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p id=\"so_11096027_11096091_0\">A return statement without an expression can be used only in functions\n  that do not return a value, that is, a function with the return type\n  void, a constructor (12.1), or a destructor (12.4).
