But I haven't seen a good use yet.</p>\n<p>Deleting a special member is not the same thing as not having a special member.  Nowhere is this more obvious than with the move constructor and move assignment operator.</p>\n<p>When present, whether deleted, defaulted, or user-defined, the move constructor and the move assignment operator participate in overload resolution.  That means that they \"compete\" with the special copy members.  The copy members will typically favor const lvalues, whereas the move members attract rvalues.</p>\n<p>When returning a local type from a function (when the local type is the same un-cv-qualified type as the return type), the return statement first considers the return expression as an rvalue, and only if it can't find a suitable constructor, will it then be considered as an lvalue.  I.e. matching the proper constructor for returning a local object from a function is a 2-phase operation.</p>\n<p>When you don't have a move constructor at all (not even deleted), but you do have a normal copy constructor (takes a const &amp;), then the rvalue from the return statement will match the copy constructor.</p>\n<p>When you <strong>do</strong> have a move constructor, even it is marked deleted, the rvalue from the return statement will find the move constructor a better match than the copy constructor.</p>\n<p><strong>Summary</strong></p>\n<p>Unless you really know what you are doing, <strong>never</strong> delete the move members.  If you don't want your type to be movable, just do not define the move members and make sure that you do declare copy members, even if the copy members are <code>=default</code>'d.</p>\n<p><strong>Update</strong></p>\n<blockquote>\n<p id=\"so_16703798_16703973_0\">I suppose it's hard to provide quotes from the Standard on what delete\n  doesn't do? \u2013 DyP</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>8.4.3 Deleted definitions [dcl.fct.def.delete]</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p id=\"so_16703798_16703973_1\">2 A program that refers to a deleted function implicitly or\n  explicitly, other than to declare it, is ill-formed.
