I believe the intent here is that a \"declaration of a reference\" is a declaration that declares a particular name to be of reference type (which a non-static data member declaration of reference type does), not necessarily a declaration that causes the lifetime of a particular reference to begin. Conversely, a \"declaration of an object\" is intended to be interpreted as a declaration that declares a particular name to name a specific object (which a non-static data member declaration does not).</p>\n<p id=\"so_42053409_42055720_1\">That is:</p>\n<pre><code>  struct A {\n    int &amp;a;\n    int b;\n  };\n</code></pre>\n<p id=\"so_42053409_42055720_2\">'a' is a declaration of a reference, and so we need another condition to restrict it from being a variable. 'b' is /not/ a declaration of an object, so we don't need to say anything further.</p>\n<p id=\"so_42053409_42055720_3\">Suggestions on how to reword this to make it clearer would be welcome :)</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>This was followed up as <a href=\"https://github.com/cplusplus/draft/issues/1280\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">https://github.com/cplusplus/draft/issues/1280</a>, some inconsistencies were found.
