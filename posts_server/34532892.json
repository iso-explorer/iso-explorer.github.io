In other words, it seems there is no case where such a member definition dwells outside the scope of the declaration. See the following example:</p>\n<pre><code>int always_visible=10;\n\nclass some {\n    int foo(void);\n};\n\nint some::foo(void) {\n    // no ambiguity occurs because its member definition\n    // is always in the scope of always_visible.\n    return always_visible;\n}\n</code></pre>\n<p>I don't think it's possible for its member definition to precede the declaration of always_visible, in which case the wording above might be useful. Then, why is that clarification needed?</p>\n", "Title": "Is \u00a73.3.7/4 from N4567 redundant?", "CreationDate": "2015-12-30T16:03:28.503", "LastActivityDate": "2015-12-30T16:03:28.503", "CommentCount": "11", "FavoriteCount": "1", "PostTypeId": "1", "Id": "34532892", "Score": "3", "OwnerUserId": "5645940", "Tags": "<c++><language-lawyer>", "AnswerCount": "0"}});
