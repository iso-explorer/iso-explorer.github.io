I think you understand that part.</p>\n<p>A static member is not present in every instance of a class, but it is a global variable shared between all classes. As such, it is not included in the class size. This is because <code>sizeof</code> is commonly used to allocate memory for an object, and there is no need to allocate memory for a variable which isn't in the class instance. This is why <code>one</code> isn't 4 bytes.</p>\n<p>The reason why it is 1 byte is because the C++ standard doesn't allow a class to have a size of 0 bytes, so the compiler has padded it up to a non-0 size.</p>\n", "LastActivityDate": "2014-07-21T13:04:41.507", "CommentCount": "0", "CreationDate": "2014-07-21T13:04:41.507", "ParentId": "24865741", "Score": "1", "OwnerUserId": "2068573"}, "24865822": {"Id": "24865822", "PostTypeId": "2", "Body": "<p><code>one</code> has no non-static members, so an instance of it is empty.
