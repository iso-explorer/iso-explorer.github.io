If all of your pointers in the list are of the same type then you should be storing that type in the list, not as <code>void</code>. If the pointers are different types but derive from a common base type, then give that base type a virtual constructor and store pointers of that type instead.</p>\n", "LastActivityDate": "2012-10-06T17:31:15.843", "CommentCount": "4", "CreationDate": "2012-10-06T17:31:15.843", "ParentId": "12761875", "Score": "2", "OwnerUserId": "65863"}, "12761979": {"Id": "12761979", "PostTypeId": "2", "Body": "<p>Deleting through a <code>void*</code> results in undefined behavior, so you are guaranteed nothing.</p>\n<blockquote>\n<h3>5.3.5 Delete [expr.delete]</h3>\n<p id=\"so_12761875_12761979_0\">1 The delete-expression operator destroys a most derived object (1.8) or array created by a new-expression.<br>\n  [...]<br>\n<strong>The operand shall have a pointer to object type, or a class type having a single non-explicit conversion function (12.3.2) to a pointer to object type</strong>.
