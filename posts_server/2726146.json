Consequently, it really makes more sense to change the type of the parameter to Foo* instead of Foo*&amp;, or to make it a Foo&amp;, in which case you would use dot (.) instead of arrow (-&gt;) when dereferencing the parameter's member.</p>\n<p><b>Edit</b><br/>\nYour new version of do_baz now makes use of the fact that the parameter is a reference. The solution above (simply using a named pointer) will still work for your new version of the problem. That said, I would advise against what you are doing. It seems you are trying to insert an element at the end of a linked list...</p>\n<p>Firstly, I would advise that if you are implementing a linked list that you maintain not only a pointer to the first node in the list, but also a pointer to the last node in the list at all times, so that insertion at the end of the list may be performed in constant-time. If, however, that is not a possibility, I would nevertheless advise you to use an iterative implementation rather than a recursive one as it is cleaner and simpler.
