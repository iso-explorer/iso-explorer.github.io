If so, then the code to release the resource belongs in a destructor that you write.</p>\n<p>For example if you allocate objects with <code>new</code> then they must be freed with <code>delete</code>. If you open a file with <code>fopen</code> then it's closed with <code>fclose</code>. If you take a Posix mutex with <code>pthread_mutex_lock</code> then it must be released with <code>pthread_mutex_unlock</code>.</p>\n<p>For each kind of resource needs freeing you (or someone else) can write a class that manages and frees that resource, and provides access to its basic operations. Hence the existence of classes like <code>std::unique_ptr</code>, <code>std::shared_ptr</code>, <code>std::lock_guard</code>, <code>std::fstream</code>. Of course, for simplicity you usually want there to be only one class that manages a particular kind of resource. So, since <code>std::lock_guard</code> exists in C++11, the only reason that you'd write your own class to release a mutex would be if you're providing some alternative interface to the standard one. Classes with non-default destructors should ideally be rare in your own code -- often there already exist classes that you can use as data members or automatic variables, and whose destructors do the job.</p>\n", "OwnerUserId": "13005", "LastEditorUserId": "13005", "LastEditDate": "2013-05-27T18:08:58.857", "Id": "16778379", "Score": "1", "CreationDate": "2013-05-27T18:03:18.727", "LastActivityDate": "2013-05-27T18:08:58.857"}});
