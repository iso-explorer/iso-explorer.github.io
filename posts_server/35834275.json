In this case, dereferencing p gets you the, er, value of your 'value' variable. With me so far?  </p>\n<p>So now, what happens in the function call? The program dereferences the pointer p, and then passes an lvalue reference to your variable (value) to the function. The function is defined to take a reference (a pointer with some syntactic sugar). So yes, you are correct in thinking it is dereferenced to an integer. However, C++ passes the address of the value variable anyway, rather than an integer variable, because you've told it to only accept references in the function.  </p>\n", "OwnerUserId": "4791654", "PostTypeId": "2", "Id": "35834374", "Score": "1", "CreationDate": "2016-03-07T00:29:43.300", "LastActivityDate": "2016-03-07T00:29:43.300"}, "bq_ids": {"n4140": {"so_35834275_35834337_1": {"section_id": 6064, "quality": 0.92, "length": 23}, "so_35834275_35834337_0": {"section_id": 5954, "quality": 0.8888888888888888, "length": 24}}, "n3337": {"so_35834275_35834337_1": {"section_id": 5832, "quality": 0.92, "length": 23}, "so_35834275_35834337_0": {"section_id": 5724, "quality": 0.8888888888888888, "length": 24}}, "n4659": {"so_35834275_35834337_1": {"section_id": 7560, "quality": 0.92, "length": 23}, "so_35834275_35834337_0": {"section_id": 7441, "quality": 0.8518518518518519, "length": 23}}}});
