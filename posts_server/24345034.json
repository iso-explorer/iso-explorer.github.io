This is not valid construction. Related to this is </p>\n<p>C++ Standard n3337 <strong>\u00a7</strong> 9.3 paragraph <strong>Member functions</strong></p>\n<blockquote>\n<p id=\"so_24345034_24345067_1\">2)\n  A member function may be defined (8.4) in its class definition, in\n  which case it is an inline member func- tion (7.1.2), or it may be\n  defined outside of its class definition if it has already been\n  declared but not defined in its class definition. A member function\n  definition that appears outside of the class definition shall appear\n  in a namespace scope enclosing the class definition. Except for member\n  function definitions that appear outside of a class definition, and\n  except for explicit specializations of member functions of class\n  templates and member function templates (14.7) appearing outside of\n  the class definition, a member function shall not be redeclared. </p>\n<p id=\"so_24345034_24345067_2\">3)\n  An\n  inline member function (whether static or non-static) may also be\n  defined outside of its class definition provided either its\n  declaration in the class definition or its definition outside of the\n  class definition declares the function as inline. [ Note: Member\n  functions of a class in namespace scope have external linkage. Member\n  functions of a local class (9.8) have no linkage. See 3.5. \u2014 end note\n  ]</p>\n<p id=\"so_24345034_24345067_3\">4) There shall be at most one definition of a non-inline member\n  function in a program; no diagnostic is required. There may be more\n  than one inline member function definition in a program. See 3.2 and\n  7.1.2.</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>You should ask yourself what is this supposed to be? What do you want to achieve? If your intent is to override it you can do it this way:</p>\n<pre><code>class A\n{\npublic:\n    virtual int foo() { return 3;}\n};\n\nclass B : public A\n{\npublic:\n    int foo() override { return 0; }\n};\n</code></pre>\n<p>If you want to use A::foo inside B then make A::foo static </p>\n<pre><code>class A\n{\npublic:\n    static int foo() { return 3;}\n};\n\nclass B\n{\npublic:\n    int bar()\n    {\n        int u = A::foo();\n        return u + 8 - 2;\n    }\n};\n</code></pre>\n<p>or instantiate A member in B:</p>\n<pre><code>class A\n{\npublic:\n    int foo() { return 3;}\n};\n\nclass B\n{\n    A a;\npublic:\n    int bar()\n    {\n        int u = a.foo();\n        return u + 8 - 2;\n    }\n};\n</code></pre>\n", "LastActivityDate": "2014-06-21T19:44:54.883"}, "24345169": {"ParentId": "24345034", "CommentCount": "0", "Body": "<p>The line</p>\n<pre><code>int A::foo(){ return 0; }\n</code></pre>\n<p>defines the member function <code>foo</code> of <code>A</code>.
