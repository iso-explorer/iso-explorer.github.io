The problem is probably caused by something wrong about your definition of the global operator itself, or perhaps about the way you use the vectors. Recommended next steps are:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>Check whether the code works when <code>::operator new</code> is not replaced</li>\n<li>Use a debugger to obtain a stack trace of the crash and analyse the stack at that point to obtain clues on what functions are involved in the crash, what the values of local variables at that point is, etc.</li>\n</ul>\n", "OwnerUserId": "777186", "LastEditorUserId": "777186", "LastEditDate": "2013-01-02T08:52:07.187", "Id": "14118791", "Score": "4", "CreationDate": "2013-01-02T08:15:29.640", "LastActivityDate": "2013-01-02T08:52:07.187"}, "14118639": {"ParentId": "14118580", "CommentCount": "0", "Body": "<p>I believe <a href=\"http://www.codeproject.com/Articles/4795/C-Standard-Allocator-An-Introduction-and-Implement\" rel=\"nofollow\">STL Allocators</a> would need to be implemented for you to control <code>vector</code>s allocations</p>\n", "OwnerUserId": "1520364", "PostTypeId": "2", "Id": "14118639", "Score": "0", "CreationDate": "2013-01-02T07:58:12.870", "LastActivityDate": "2013-01-02T07:58:12.870"}, "bq_ids": {"n4140": {"so_14118580_14118791_1": {"section_id": 4240, "quality": 0.7333333333333333, "length": 11}}, "n3337": {"so_14118580_14118791_1": {"section_id": 4081, "quality": 0.7333333333333333, "length": 11}}, "n4659": {"so_14118580_14118791_1": {"section_id": 6399, "quality": 0.7333333333333333, "length": 11}}}});
