Is there something within the C++ specification that says that macro substitution doesn't occur within parens?  If so where is that?  Is this just a side effect of something else or is the language designed to work that way?  If I use extra parens the <code>max</code> macro doesn't cause a problem:</p>\n<pre><code>(std::numeric_limits&lt;int&gt;::max)()\n</code></pre>\n<p>I'm working in a large scale MFC project, and there are some windows libraries that use those macros so I'd prefer not to use the <code>#undef</code> trick.  </p>\n<p>My other question is this.  Does <code>#undef max</code> within a .cpp file only affect the file that it is used within, or would it undefine <code>max</code> for other compilation units?  </p>\n", "Tags": "<c++><stl>", "OwnerUserId": "2993440", "AnswerCount": "1"}, "bq_ids": {"n4140": {"so_23022349_23022366_0": {"section_id": 520, "quality": 0.95, "length": 19}}, "n3337": {"so_23022349_23022366_0": {"section_id": 511, "quality": 0.95, "length": 19}}, "n4659": {"so_23022349_23022366_0": {"section_id": 541, "quality": 0.95, "length": 19}}}});
