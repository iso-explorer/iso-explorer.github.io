However I do not think it is necessary. Citing from N4296 \u00a713.3.1.2/4:</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p id=\"so_43309255_43309255_0\">For the built-in assignment operators, conversions of the left operand\n  are restricted as follows: </p>\n<p id=\"so_43309255_43309255_1\">(4.1) \u2014 <strong>no temporaries are introduced to hold the left operand</strong>, and</p>\n<p id=\"so_43309255_43309255_2\">(4.2) \u2014 no user-defined conversions are applied to the left operand to achieve a type match with the left-most\n  parameter of a built-in candidate.</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>I understand the second rule (see for example <a href=\"https://stackoverflow.com/a/39937432/6209703\">https://stackoverflow.com/a/39937432/6209703</a>), but the first seems rendundant to me. All built-in operators are described in \u00a713.6, and there are only three assignment operators (paragraphs 18, 19, 20). Their first argument is always a reference to a non-const type, and such references cannot be bound to temporaries.</p>\n", "Tags": "<c++><language-lawyer><assignment-operator>", "OwnerUserId": "6209703", "AnswerCount": "0"}, "bq_ids": {"n4140": {"so_43309255_43309255_1": {"section_id": 585, "quality": 1.0, "length": 5}, "so_43309255_43309255_2": {"section_id": 585, "quality": 1.0, "length": 12}, "so_43309255_43309255_0": {"section_id": 585, "quality": 0.8888888888888888, "length": 8}}, "n3337": {"so_43309255_43309255_1": {"section_id": 575, "quality": 1.0, "length": 5}, "so_43309255_43309255_2": {"section_id": 575, "quality": 1.0, "length": 12}, "so_43309255_43309255_0": {"section_id": 575, "quality": 0.8888888888888888, "length": 8}}, "n4659": {"so_43309255_43309255_1": {"section_id": 608, "quality": 1.0, "length": 5}, "so_43309255_43309255_2": {"section_id": 608, "quality": 1.0, "length": 12}, "so_43309255_43309255_0": {"section_id": 608, "quality": 0.8888888888888888, "length": 8}}}});
