As for what actually happens on an x86 machine when you issue a shift by a variable amount, refer to the <a href=\"http://www.intel.com/content/www/us/en/processors/architectures-software-developer-manuals.html\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">Intel Software Developer Manual</a> Volume 2B, p. 4-506:</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p id=\"so_10499104_10503233_0\">The count is masked to 5 bits (or 6 bits\n  if in 64-bit mode and REX.W is used). The count range is limited to 0 to 31 (or 63 if\n  64-bit mode and REX.W is used).</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>So if you attempt to shift by an amount larger than 31 or 63 (for 32- and 64-bit values respectively), the hardware will only use the bottom 5 or 6 bits of the shift amount.  So this code:</p>\n<pre><code>uint32_t RightShift(uint32_t value, uint32_t count)\n{\n    return value &gt;&gt; count;\n}\n</code></pre>\n<p>Will result in <code>RightShift(2, 33) == 1</code> on x86 and x86-64.  It's still <strong>undefined behavior</strong> according to the C standard, but on x86, if the compiler compiles it down to a <code>sar</code> instruction, it will have defined behavior on that architecture.  But you should still avoid writing this sort of code that depends on architecture-specific quirks.</p>\n", "LastEditorUserId": "-1", "LastActivityDate": "2012-05-08T18:02:20.757", "Score": "4", "CreationDate": "2012-05-08T17:12:56.067", "ParentId": "10499104", "CommentCount": "1", "OwnerUserId": "9530", "LastEditDate": "2017-05-23T11:53:35.590"}, "bq_ids": {"n4140": {"so_10499104_10499451_0": {"length": 9, "quality": 0.6923076923076923, "section_id": 6146}, "so_10499104_10499371_2": {"length": 20, "quality": 0.8333333333333334, "section_id": 6148}, "so_10499104_10499371_0": {"length": 16, "quality": 0.64, "section_id": 6146}, "so_10499104_10499371_1": {"length": 31, "quality": 0.8157894736842105, "section_id": 6147}}, "n3337": {"so_10499104_10499451_0": {"length": 9, "quality": 0.6923076923076923, "section_id": 5909}, "so_10499104_10499371_2": {"length": 20, "quality": 0.8333333333333334, "section_id": 5911}, "so_10499104_10499371_0": {"length": 16, "quality": 0.64, "section_id": 5909}, "so_10499104_10499371_1": {"length": 31, "quality": 0.8157894736842105, "section_id": 5910}}, "n4659": {"so_10499104_10499451_0": {"length": 9, "quality": 0.6923076923076923, "section_id": 7642}, "so_10499104_10499371_2": {"length": 20, "quality": 0.8333333333333334, "section_id": 7644}, "so_10499104_10499371_0": {"length": 16, "quality": 0.64, "section_id": 7642}, "so_10499104_10499371_1": {"length": 31, "quality": 0.8157894736842105, "section_id": 7643}}}, "10499104": {"ViewCount": "10861", "Body": "<p>Learning the hard way, I tried to left shift a <code>long long</code> and <code>uint64_t</code> to more than 32 bits on an x86 machine resulted <code>0</code>.
