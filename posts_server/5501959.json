The default <code>const</code>ness lets it be used in a constant environment, just like normal <code>const</code>-qualified functions can be used there, but non-<code>const</code>-qualified ones can't. Maybe they just thought to make it more intuitive for those cases, who know what goes on in their mind. :)</p>\n", "LastEditorUserId": "500104", "LastActivityDate": "2011-03-31T15:49:14.003", "Score": "13", "CreationDate": "2011-03-31T15:10:33.320", "ParentId": "5501959", "CommentCount": "7", "OwnerUserId": "500104", "LastEditDate": "2011-03-31T15:49:14.003"}, "5502247": {"Id": "5502247", "PostTypeId": "2", "Body": "<blockquote>\n<p id=\"so_5501959_5502247_0\">I was under the impression that the whole point of capture-by-value is to allow the user to change the temporary -- otherwise I'm almost always better off using capture-by-reference, aren't I?</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>The question is, is it \"almost\"?
