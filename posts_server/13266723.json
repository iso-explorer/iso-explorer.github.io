There is another qualification which applies to iterators:\nwhether they allow mutating the sequence or not.  This qualification is\northogonal to forward, bidirectional etc.  Formally, a non-mutating\nforward iterator must also be a non-mutating output iterator.  Of\ncourse, a non-mutating output iterator doesn't really make much sense,\nand once you've removed the mutating operators from an output iterator,\nthere's not much left, but it is easier to specify and describe the\niterators in this manner, treating mutating/non-mutating as an\northogonal characteristic. </p>\n", "LastActivityDate": "2012-11-07T09:35:58.727", "CommentCount": "0", "CreationDate": "2012-11-07T09:35:58.727", "ParentId": "13266723", "Score": "0", "OwnerUserId": "649665"}});
