It's guaranteed that both <code>std::vector&lt;A*&gt;</code> and <code>std::vector&lt;B*&gt;</code> store their pointers in a continguous block of memory. It's also guaranteed that <code>sizeof(A*) == sizeof(B*)</code>. Finally, <code>A* a = new B</code> is perfectly legal.</p>\n<p>So what bad spirits in the standard did I conjure (except style)?</p>\n", "AcceptedAnswerId": "4807726", "Title": "Container covariance in C++", "CreationDate": "2011-01-26T17:19:22.283", "Id": "4807643", "CommentCount": "12", "FavoriteCount": "3", "PostTypeId": "1", "LastEditDate": "2017-05-23T12:15:28.880", "LastEditorUserId": "-1", "LastActivityDate": "2012-10-24T15:24:03.353", "Score": "16", "OwnerUserId": "454406", "Tags": "<c++><covariance>", "AnswerCount": "4"}, "4808683": {"Id": "4808683", "PostTypeId": "2", "Body": "<p>The general problem with covariance in containers is the following:</p>\n<p>Let's say your cast would work and be legal (it isn't but let's assume it is for the following example):</p>\n<pre><code>#include &lt;vector&gt;\nstruct A {};\nstruct B : A { public: int Method(int x, int z); };\nstruct C : A { public: bool Method(char y); };\nstd::vector&lt;B*&gt; test;\nstd::vector&lt;A*&gt;* foo = reinterpret_cast&lt;std::vector&lt;A*&gt;*&gt;(&amp;test);\nfoo-&gt;push_back(new C);\ntest[0]-&gt;Method(7, 99); // What should happen here???\n</code></pre>\n<p>So you have also reinterpret-casted a C* to a B*...</p>\n<p>Actually I don't know how .NET and Java manage this (I think they throw an exception when trying to insert a C).</p>\n", "LastActivityDate": "2011-01-26T18:56:43.927", "CommentCount": "2", "CreationDate": "2011-01-26T18:56:43.927", "ParentId": "4807643", "Score": "3", "OwnerUserId": "44086"}, "4807836": {"Id": "4807836", "PostTypeId": "2", "Body": "<p>You are invoking the bad spirit of reinterpret_cast&lt;&gt;.</p>\n<p>Unless you really know what you do (I mean not proudly and not pedantically) reinterpret_cast is one of the gates of evil. </p>\n<p>The only safe use I know of is managing classes and structures between C++ and C functions calls.\nThere maybe some others however.</p>\n", "LastActivityDate": "2011-01-26T17:35:26.023", "CommentCount": "0", "CreationDate": "2011-01-26T17:35:26.023", "ParentId": "4807643", "Score": "3", "OwnerUserId": "356440"}, "bq_ids": {"n4140": {"so_4807643_4807726_4": {"length": 10, "quality": 1.0, "section_id": 7239}, "so_4807643_4807726_7": {"length": 4, "quality": 1.0, "section_id": 45}, "so_4807643_4807726_2": {"length": 5, "quality": 1.0, "section_id": 7239}, "so_4807643_4807726_3": {"length": 8, "quality": 1.0, "section_id": 7239}, "so_4807643_4807726_6": {"length": 9, "quality": 1.0, "section_id": 7239}, "so_4807643_4807726_5": {"length": 16, "quality": 1.0, "section_id": 7239}, "so_4807643_4807726_0": {"length": 13, "quality": 0.9285714285714286, "section_id": 7239}}, "n3337": {"so_4807643_4807726_4": {"length": 10, "quality": 1.0, "section_id": 6983}, "so_4807643_4807726_7": {"length": 4, "quality": 1.0, "section_id": 42}, "so_4807643_4807726_2": {"length": 5, "quality": 1.0, "section_id": 6983}, "so_4807643_4807726_0": {"length": 13, "quality": 0.9285714285714286, "section_id": 6983}, "so_4807643_4807726_6": {"length": 9, "quality": 1.0, "section_id": 6983}, "so_4807643_4807726_5": {"length": 16, "quality": 1.0, "section_id": 6983}, "so_4807643_4807726_3": {"length": 8, "quality": 1.0, "section_id": 6983}}, "n4659": {"so_4807643_4807726_4": {"length": 10, "quality": 1.0, "section_id": 8748}, "so_4807643_4807726_7": {"length": 4, "quality": 1.0, "section_id": 46}, "so_4807643_4807726_2": {"length": 5, "quality": 1.0, "section_id": 8748}, "so_4807643_4807726_0": {"length": 13, "quality": 0.9285714285714286, "section_id": 8748}, "so_4807643_4807726_6": {"length": 9, "quality": 1.0, "section_id": 8748}, "so_4807643_4807726_5": {"length": 16, "quality": 1.0, "section_id": 8748}, "so_4807643_4807726_3": {"length": 8, "quality": 1.0, "section_id": 8748}}}, "4807971": {"Id": "4807971", "PostTypeId": "2", "Body": "<p>I think it'll be easier to show than tell:</p>\n<pre><code>struct A { int a; };\n\nstruct Stranger { int a; };\n\nstruct B: Stranger, A {};\n\nint main(int argc, char* argv[])\n{\n  B someObject;\n  B* b = &amp;someObject;\n\n  A* correct = b;\n  A* incorrect = reinterpret_cast&lt;A*&gt;(b);\n\n  assert(correct != incorrect); // troubling, isn't it ?\n\n  return 0;\n}\n</code></pre>\n<p>The (specific) issue showed here is that when doing a \"proper\" conversion, the compiler adds some pointer ajdustement depending on the memory layout of the objects.
