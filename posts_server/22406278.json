post_cb({"22406916": {"Id": "22406916", "PostTypeId": "2", "Body": "<p>As you've heard now, you can't mix them.</p>\n<p>Keep in mind that in C++ it's common to have lots of relatively small temporary objects dynamically allocated (for instance, it's easy to write code like <code>my_string + ' ' + your_string + '\\n'</code>), while in C memory allocation's typically more deliberate, often with a larger average allocation size and longer lifetime (much more likely someone would directly <code>malloc(strlen(my_string) + strlen(your_string) + 3)</code> for the result without any temporary buffers).  For that reason, some C++ libraries will optimise for large numbers of small transient objects.  They might, for instance, use <code>malloc()</code> to get three 16k blocks, then use each for fixed-size requests of up to 16, 32 and 64 bytes respectively.  If you call <code>delete</code> in such a situation, it doesn't free anything - it just returns the particular entry in the 16k buffer to a C++-library free list.  If you called <code>free()</code> and the pointer happened to be to the first element in the 16k buffer, you'd accidentally deallocate all the elements; if it wasn't to the first you have undefined behaviour (but some implementations like Visual C++ apparently still free blocks given a pointer anywhere inside them).</p>\n<p>So - really, really don't do it.</p>\n<p>Even if it ostensibly works on your current system, it's a bomb waiting to go off.  Different runtime behaviour (based on different inputs, thread race conditions etc.) could cause a later failure.  Compilation with different optimisation flags, compiler version, OS etc. could all break it at any time.</p>\n", "LastActivityDate": "2014-03-14T13:50:23.103", "CommentCount": "0", "CreationDate": "2014-03-14T13:50:23.103", "ParentId": "22406278", "Score": "2", "OwnerUserId": "410767"}, "22406327": {"Id": "22406327", "PostTypeId": "2", "Body": "<p>You must use <code>delete</code> operator to deallocate memory when it is allocated by <code>new</code> operator.  </p>\n", "LastEditorUserId": "2455888", "LastActivityDate": "2014-03-14T13:37:09.020", "Score": "0", "CreationDate": "2014-03-14T13:26:17.900", "ParentId": "22406278", "CommentCount": "2", "OwnerUserId": "2455888", "LastEditDate": "2014-03-14T13:37:09.020"}, "22406278": {"ViewCount": "876", "Body": "<p>I'm working on a C++ library, one of whose functions returns a (freshly allocated) pointer to an array of doubles.
