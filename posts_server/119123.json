A particular processor has a preferred data size that it works with.  Most modern processors' preferred size if 32-bits (4 bytes).  Accessing the memory when data is on this kind of boundary is more efficient than things that straddle that size boundary.</p>\n<p>For example.  Consider the simple structure:</p>\n<pre><code>struct myStruct\n{\n   int a;\n   char b;\n   int c;\n} data;\n</code></pre>\n<p>If the machine is a 32-bit machine and data is aligned on a 32-bit boundary, we see an immediate problem (assuming no structure alignment).  In this example, let us assume that the structure data starts at address 1024 (0x400 - note that the lowest 2 bits are zero, so the data is aligned to a 32-bit boundary).  The access to data.a will work fine because it starts on a boundary - 0x400.  The access to data.b will also work fine, because it is at address 0x404 - another 32-bit boundary.  But an unaligned structure would put data.c at address 0x405.  The 4 bytes of data.c are at 0x405, 0x406, 0x407, 0x408.  On a 32-bit machine, the system would read data.c during one memory cycle, but would only get 3 of the 4 bytes (the 4th byte is on the next boundary).  So, the system would have to do a second memory access to get the 4th byte,</p>\n<p>Now, if instead of putting data.c at address 0x405, the compiler padded the structure by 3 bytes and put data.c at address 0x408, then the system would only need 1 cycle to read the data, cutting access time to that data element by 50%.  Padding swaps memory efficiency for processing efficiency.  Given that computers can have huge amounts of memory (many gigabytes), the compilers feel that the swap (speed over size) is a reasonable one.</p>\n<p>Unfortunately, this problem becomes a killer when you attempt to send structures over a network or even write the binary data to a binary file.  The padding inserted between elements of a structure or class can disrupt the data sent to the file or network.  In order to write portable code (one that will go to several different compilers), you will probably have to access each element of the structure separately to ensure the proper \"packing\".</p>\n<p>On the other hand, different compilers have different abilities to manage data structure packing.  For example, in Visual C/C++ the compiler supports the #pragma pack command.  This will allow you to adjust data packing and alignment.</p>\n<p>For example:</p>\n<pre><code>#pragma pack 1\nstruct MyStruct\n{\n    int a;\n    char b;\n    int c;\n    short d;\n} myData;\n\nI = sizeof(myData);\n</code></pre>\n<p>I should now have the length of 11.  Without the pragma, I could be anything from 11 to 14 (and for some systems, as much as 32), depending on the default packing of the compiler.</p>\n", "LastEditorUserId": "4995406", "LastActivityDate": "2015-06-12T06:50:22.897", "Score": "4", "CreationDate": "2015-06-10T15:07:08.930", "ParentId": "119123", "CommentCount": "6", "OwnerUserId": "4995406", "LastEditDate": "2015-06-12T06:50:22.897"}, "31687400": {"Id": "31687400", "PostTypeId": "2", "Body": "<p><strong>C language leaves compiler some freedom about the location of the structural elements in the memory:</strong></p>\n<ul>\n<li>memory holes may appear between any two components, and after the last component.
