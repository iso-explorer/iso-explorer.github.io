In fact, it isn't even safe for pointers.  According to the standard, a pointer can only safely point to within an array or the one-past-the-end element of an array, and pointers into different arrays aren't portably comparable to each other.  (On modern hardware, general pointer comparisons usually work, but this isn't guaranteed.  If you want portability, you'd need to use <code>std::less&lt;&gt;</code>.)</p>\n", "LastActivityDate": "2013-05-15T14:25:21.923", "CommentCount": "0", "CreationDate": "2013-05-15T14:25:21.923", "ParentId": "16567587", "Score": "2", "OwnerUserId": "798193"}, "16567587": {"ViewCount": "65", "Body": "<p>When I have simple pointer I can safely wrap array like this:</p>\n<pre><code>p+=X;   // p pointer p can point beyond end of array\nif(p&gt;=array+array_size) p-=array_size;    // forget about potential multiple wrap\n</code></pre>\n<p>can I do the same safely for iterator over any indexable container, esp. deque?:</p>\n<pre><code>p+=x;\nif(p&gt;=mydeque.end()) p-=mydeque.size(); // forget about potential multiple wrap\n</code></pre>\n<p>In other words: is it safe to take into calculations iterator pointing beyond collection?</p>\n", "AcceptedAnswerId": "16567705", "Title": "Is it safe to use iterator pointing beyond indexable collection in calculations?", "CreationDate": "2013-05-15T14:19:35.920", "Id": "16567587", "CommentCount": "1", "LastEditDate": "2013-05-15T14:32:24.197", "PostTypeId": "1", "LastEditorUserId": "727238", "LastActivityDate": "2013-05-15T14:32:24.197", "Score": "3", "OwnerUserId": "727238", "Tags": "<c++>", "AnswerCount": "3"}});
