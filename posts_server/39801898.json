The elements of a vector are objects <em>(with the exception of the abomination which is the <code>std::vector&lt;bool&gt;</code> specialization)</em>. So yes, they all have unique addresses. Keep in mind though, that when you add elements to a vector, it may reallocate. And when it reallocates, all the old objects are destroyed and moved to new objects with different addresses, and the old memory is free to be reused, perhaps by further reallocations of the same vector. The following is possible, for example:</p>\n<pre><code>std::vector&lt;int&gt; v;\nv.push_back(0);\nstd::intptr_t a0 = (std::intptr_t)&amp;v[0];\n\nv.push_back(1); // a reallocation may happen here\nv.push_back(2); // and perhaps another one here\n\nstd::intptr_t a2 = (std::intptr_t)&amp;v[2];\n\nif (a0 == a2) {\n    std::cout &lt;&lt; \"This code is unlikely to be executed, but technically possible.\";\n}\n</code></pre>\n", "LastActivityDate": "2016-10-01T01:26:55.590", "CommentCount": "1", "CreationDate": "2016-10-01T01:26:55.590", "ParentId": "39801898", "Score": "2", "OwnerUserId": "440119"}, "39801982": {"Id": "39801982", "PostTypeId": "2", "Body": "<p>Each element does indeed have a unique address in memory.
