In the same way that you can provide a <code>const</code> qualifier to any member function in C++03, you can also add a <em>ref-qualifier</em> to a member function in C++0x.

I'm not positive what that part of the standard is talking about, but I have a guess.</p>\n<p>I suspect there is a qualifier saying that your function is being called on an rvalue reference.  Something like this:</p>\n<pre><code>class A {\n public:\n   void IAmAnRValue() &amp;&amp;;\n};\n</code></pre>\n<p>I think the language in the standard is saying that this qualifier is not allowed on a destructor, much like having a trailing <code>const</code> would also be illegal.</p>\n<p>And, on further investigation, my certainty of  the correctness of my surmise goes up considerably.  Here is the justification:</p>\n<ul>\n<li><a href=\"http://www.open-std.org/jtc1/sc22/wg21/docs/papers/2007/n2439.htm\" rel=\"nofollow\">Extending Move Semantics to <code>*this</code></a>.</li>\n</ul>\n<p>There it clearly states that functions may now have a 'ref-qualifier' after the 'cv-qualifer'. This means that a function declaration may now be followed by <code>const &amp;</code> or <code>const volatile &amp;&amp;</code> instead of just <code>const</code>. And the term used (ref-qualifier) is the same as the term used in the little bit of the standard you're quoting. And it makes sense for destructors to not be able to have one.</p>\n", "LastEditorUserId": "167958", "LastActivityDate": "2011-09-07T06:35:47.143", "Score": "10", "CreationDate": "2011-09-07T06:24:20.090", "ParentId": "7329617", "CommentCount": "1", "OwnerUserId": "167958", "LastEditDate": "2011-09-07T06:35:47.143"}, "7338579": {"Id": "7338579", "PostTypeId": "2", "Body": "<p>The rule you are looking for is stated in the same paragraph, 12.4p2</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p id=\"so_7329617_7338579_0\">A destructor takes no parameters, and no return type can be specified for it (not even void).</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>The phrase \"no return type can be specified for it\" also forbids \"*\", which is not immediately clear but can be seen by comparison with 12.3.2p1 (compare with <a href=\"http://www.open-std.org/jtc1/sc22/wg21/docs/cwg_active.html#395\" rel=\"nofollow\">this issue report</a>):</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p id=\"so_7329617_7338579_1\">...
