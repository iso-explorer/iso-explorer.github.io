Also imagine that <code>::A</code> and <code>::C::A</code> are unrelated. You would expect that a call like <code>a-&gt;foo()</code> (which used to work) would fail because <code>foo</code> is no longer accessible, but instead of this the type of <code>a</code> has changed behind your back and you now get a \"there is no method <code>foo</code>\" error. Huh?!? And that's of course far from the worst that could happen.</p>\n</hr>", "LastEditorUserId": "50079", "LastActivityDate": "2013-03-12T10:10:22.967", "Score": "11", "CreationDate": "2013-03-11T15:34:23.260", "ParentId": "15342410", "CommentCount": "2", "LastEditDate": "2013-03-12T10:10:22.967", "OwnerUserId": "50079"}});
