Note that you never use the result of <code>-&gt;</code> directly, but always in an expression of the form <code>thing-&gt;member</code>. </p>\n<p>If <code>thing</code> is a class type, that's evaluated by calling <code>operator-&gt;</code>, then applying <code>-&gt;member</code> to the result of that. To support that, it must return either a pointer, or another class type which also overloads <code>operator-&gt;</code>.</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p id=\"so_29434001_29434142_2\">can I make dereferencing operator returns by pointer</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>Yes, but that would be rather confusing since it would behave differently to applying the same operator a pointer. You'd have to say <code>**thing</code> to access the <code>T</code>.</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p id=\"so_29434001_29434142_3\">while the other one returns by reference</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>No, because that would break the language's built-in assumptions about how the overloaded operator should work, making it unusable.</p>\n", "OwnerUserId": "204847", "PostTypeId": "2", "Id": "29434142", "Score": "1", "CreationDate": "2015-04-03T14:31:58.313", "LastActivityDate": "2015-04-03T14:31:58.313"}, "29434001": {"CommentCount": "1", "ViewCount": "185", "CreationDate": "2015-04-03T14:23:28.793", "LastActivityDate": "2015-04-03T14:35:11.417", "Title": "Regarding definition of dereferencing and member selection operators in smart pointer", "AcceptedAnswerId": "29434142", "PostTypeId": "1", "Id": "29434001", "Score": "0", "Body": "<p>In smart pointer implementation, dereferencing operator and member selection operators are always defined as below. </p>\n<pre><code>T&amp; operator* () const     // dereferencing operator\n{\n    return *(m_pRawPointer); \n}\n\nT* operator-&gt;() const     // member selection operator\n{\n    return m_pRowPointer;\n}\n</code></pre>\n<p>I don't quite understand why the former is returned by reference, the latter is returned by pointer.
