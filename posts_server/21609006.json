[ Example:</p>\n<pre><code>class M {  \n    friend void f() { } // definition of global f, a friend of M,  \n                        // not the definition of a member function  \n};  \n\u2014end example ]\n</code></pre>\n<p id=\"so_21609006_21609006_1\">Such a function is implicitly <code>inline</code>.
