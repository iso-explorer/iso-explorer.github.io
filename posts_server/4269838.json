Good news is that the interviewer probably doesn't know that and will assume you are because it's the result THEY get when they compile and run it.</p>\n<p>True answer is that it is implementation defined.  I'm not 100% confident to say it IS undefined behavior because of the overload, but I think it may be.  At the very least though the result is dependent upon how negative numbers are represented, etc...  Neither language you've claimed this is in define what the output will be.</p>\n", "LastActivityDate": "2010-11-24T17:48:19.077", "Score": "11", "CreationDate": "2010-11-24T17:48:19.077", "ParentId": "4269838", "CommentCount": "3", "OwnerUserId": "301883"}, "4527827": {"Id": "4527827", "PostTypeId": "2", "Body": "<pre><code>Binary of 1  : 0000 0000 0000 0000 0000 0000 0000 00001\n</code></pre>\n<p>Replace occurrence of 0 with 1 as you are going to calculate binary of negative no</p>\n<p><a href=\"http://www.tutorvista.com/math/multiplying-binary-numbers\" rel=\"noreferrer\">How to calculate binary of negative numbers</a></p>\n<pre><code>Binary of -1 : 1111 1111 1111 1111 1111 1111 1111 11111\n\nLeft shift 4 : 1111 1111 1111 1111 1111 1111 1111 0000\n</code></pre>\n<p>Hex Representation of of resultant Left shift 4 \nwill be</p>\n<pre><code>1111 : F \n\n0000 : 0\n</code></pre>\n<p>so calculated output will be : </p>\n<pre><code>FFFFFFF0\n</code></pre>\n<p>Your answer is Right.</p>\n", "LastEditorUserId": "540162", "LastActivityDate": "2011-10-23T03:22:29.027", "Score": "7", "CreationDate": "2010-12-24T18:41:16.800", "ParentId": "4269838", "CommentCount": "1", "LastEditDate": "2011-10-23T03:22:29.027", "OwnerUserId": "435559"}, "4269838": {"ViewCount": "7297", "Body": "<p>I was asked the output of the following code in my interview yesterday</p>\n<pre><code>#include &lt;stdio.h&gt;\nint main(void){\n       printf (\"%x\" ,-1&lt;&lt;4); \n}\n</code></pre>\n<p>I was given 2 minutes to tell the answer.
