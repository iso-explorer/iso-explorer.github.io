A byte is at least large enough to contain\n  any member of the basic execution character set (2.3) and the eight-bit code units of the Unicode UTF-8\n  encoding form and is composed of a contiguous sequence of bits, the number of which is implementationdefined.\n  The least significant bit is called the low-order bit; the most significant bit is called the high-order\n  bit. The memory available to a C++ program consists of one or more sequences of contiguous bytes. Every\n  byte has a unique address.</p>\n<p id=\"so_42632224_42632606_1\">1.8 The C++ object model [intro.object]<br/>...<br/>\n  5 Unless it is a bit-field (9.6), a most derived object shall have a non-zero size and shall occupy one or more\n  bytes of storage.</p>\n<p id=\"so_42632224_42632606_2\">2.3 Character sets [lex.charset]<br/>...the value of each character after 0 in the\n  above list of decimal digits shall be one greater than the value of the previous.</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>So the C++ standard guarantees that a <code>char</code> has at least 8 bits and that the digit codes have consecutive values.
