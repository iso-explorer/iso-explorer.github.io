The real reason it's disallowed is that it violates the one-definition-rule (which by the way is also mentioned as the second reason why it's illegal). </p>\n<p>To see that it's actually allowed (to redefine keywords), at least if you don't use the standard libraries, you have to look at an entirely different part of the standard, namely the translation phases. It says that the input is only decomposed into preprocessor tokens before preprocessing takes place and looking at those there's no distinction between <code>private</code> and <code>fubar</code>, they are both <code>identifiers</code> to the preprocessor. Later when the input is decomposed into <code>token</code> the replacement has already taken place.</p>\n<p>It has been pointed out that there's a restriction on programs that are to use the standard libraries, but it's not evident that the example redefining <code>private</code> is doing that (as opposed to the \"Person #4: The Language Lawyer\" snippet which uses it for output to <code>cout</code>).</p>\n<p>It's mentioned in the last example that the trick doesn't get trampled on by other translation units or tramples on other. With this in mind you should probably consider the possibility that the standard library is being used somewhere else which will put this restriction in effect.</p>\n", "LastActivityDate": "2015-12-16T14:35:31.493", "CommentCount": "0", "CreationDate": "2015-12-16T14:35:31.493", "ParentId": "9109377", "Score": "0", "OwnerUserId": "4498329"}});
