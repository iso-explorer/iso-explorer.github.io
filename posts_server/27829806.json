If you need to use the operations you need to make synchronize the accesses between the different threads somehow. The relevant clauses in the standard are 17.6.4.10 [res.on.objects] paragraph 1:</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p id=\"so_27829806_27829863_0\">The behavior of a program is undefined if calls to standard library functions from different threads may\n  introduce a data race.
