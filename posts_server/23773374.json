This is because you are trying to pass a non-POD type to a variadic function, one that takes a variable number of arguments. In this case by calling <code>printf</code> which is declared something like the below</p>\n<pre><code>int printf ( const char * format, ... );\n</code></pre>\n<p>The ellipsis used as the last parameter allows you to pass 0 or more additional arguments to the function as you are doing in your code. The C++ standard <strong>does</strong> allow you to pass a non-POD type but compilers are not <strong>required</strong> to support it. This is covered in part by 5.2.2/7 of the standard.</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p id=\"so_23773374_23773551_0\">Passing a potentially-evaluated argument of class type having a non-trivial copy constructor, a non-trivial move contructor, or a non-trivial destructor, with no corresponding parameter, is conditionally-supported with implementation-defined semantics.</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>This means it is up to each compiler maker to decide <strong>if</strong> they want to support it <strong>and</strong> how it will behave.
