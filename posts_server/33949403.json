Perhaps there are many different choices of type that would be completely consistent.... the compiler has no way of choosing one.  So, it requires that the return type be deduced (by seeing the return statement inside the function body) before it is needed.</p>\n", "OwnerUserId": "103167", "PostTypeId": "2", "Id": "33950753", "Score": "2", "CreationDate": "2015-11-27T05:25:29.930", "LastActivityDate": "2015-11-27T05:25:29.930"}, "33949403": {"CommentCount": "3", "ViewCount": "597", "PostTypeId": "1", "LastEditorUserId": "2760433", "CreationDate": "2015-11-27T02:15:40.317", "LastActivityDate": "2015-11-27T05:25:29.930", "Title": "Auto function must be defined before it is used", "LastEditDate": "2015-11-27T05:10:19.717", "Id": "33949403", "Score": "0", "Body": "<p>Say we have two member functions:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>public foo()</li>\n<li>private bar()</li>\n</ul>\n<p>We want to call bar() in foo():</p>\n<pre><code>&gt; cat test.cpp\nclass a\n{\npublic:\n    auto foo()\n    {\n        auto a = bar();\n    }\nprivate:\n    auto bar()\n    {\n        return 1;\n    }\n};\n&gt; g++ test.cpp -std=c++14\ntest.cpp:6:12: error: function 'bar' with deduced return type cannot be used before it is defined\n            auto a = bar();\n                     ^\ntest.cpp:9:7: note: 'bar' declared here\n    auto bar()\n         ^\n</code></pre>\n<p>Does that mean I have to defined the <strong>private bar() before the public foo()</strong> to get through the compilation?</p>\n<p>But I'm used to defining <strong>public members before private ones</strong>...</p>\n<p>Will the parser be improved to allow calling <code>auto function()</code> before its definition?</p>\n", "Tags": "<c++><c++14><auto>", "OwnerUserId": "2760433", "AnswerCount": "1"}, "bq_ids": {"n4140": {"so_33949403_33950753_0": {"section_id": 5455, "quality": 1.0, "length": 10}}, "n3337": {"so_33949403_33950753_0": {"section_id": 3191, "quality": 0.6, "length": 6}}, "n4659": {"so_33949403_33950753_0": {"section_id": 6881, "quality": 1.0, "length": 10}}}});
