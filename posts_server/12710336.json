As Dietmar points out in his answer, an implementation might declare that normal memory \"cannot be observed\". This would come as a surprise to people using debuggers, <code>mprotect</code>, or other stuff outside the scope of the standard, but it could conform in principle.]</p>\n<p>In C++03, which does not consider threads at all, it is up to the implementation to define what \"accessing the address\" means when running in a thread. Details like this are called the \"memory model\". Pthreads, for example, allows per-thread caching of the whole of memory, including volatile variables. IIRC, MSVC provides a guarantee that volatile variables of suitable size are atomic, and it will avoid caching (rather, it will flush as far as a single coherent cache for all cores). The reason it provides that guarantee is because it's <em>reasonably</em> cheap to do so on Intel -- Windows only really cares about Intel-based architectures, whereas Posix concerns itself with more exotic stuff.</p>\n<p>C++11 defines a memory model for threading, and it says that this is a data race (i.e. that <code>volatile</code> <em>does not</em> ensure that a read in one thread is sequenced relative to a write in another thread). Two accesses can be sequenced in a particular order, sequenced in unspecified order (the standard might say \"indeterminate order\", I can't remember), or not sequenced at all. Not sequenced at all is bad -- if either of two unsequenced accesses is a write then behavior is undefined.</p>\n<p>The key here is the implied \"and then\" in \"I modify an element from a thread AND THEN the thread reading it does not notice the change\". You're assuming that the operations are sequenced, but they're not. As far as the reading thread is concerned, unless you use some kind of synchronization the write in the other thread hasn't necessarily happened yet. And actually it's worse than that -- you might think from what I just wrote that it's only the order of operations that is unspecified, but actually the behavior of a program with a data race is undefined.</p>\n", "OwnerUserId": "13005", "LastEditorUserId": "13005", "LastEditDate": "2012-10-03T15:32:11.910", "Id": "12710499", "Score": "5", "CreationDate": "2012-10-03T14:20:52.637", "LastActivityDate": "2012-10-03T15:32:11.910"}, "12710939": {"ParentId": "12710336", "CommentCount": "1", "Body": "<p><strong>C</strong></p>\n<p>What volatile does:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>Guarantees an up-to-date value in the variable, if the variable is modified from an external source (a hardware register, an interrupt, a different thread, a callback function etc).</li>\n<li>Blocks all optimizations of read/write access to the variable.</li>\n<li>Prevent dangerous optimization bugs that can happen to variables shared between several threads/interrupts/callback functions, when the compiler does not realize that the thread/interrupt/callback is called by the program.

Informally, the <code>volatile</code> declaration tells <em>every</em> thread the value might change somehow regardless of the text in <em>any</em> thread. Under the Standards with threads, there isn't any notion of a write by another thread causing a change in an object, volatile or not, shared or not, except for a shared variable by the synchronizing function call at the start of a synchronized critical region. <code>volatile</code> is <em>irrelevant</em> to thread shared objects.</p>\n<p>If your code doesn't properly synchronize the thread you are talking about, your one thread reading what an other thread wrote has undefined behaviour.
