It then lists exceptions to the undefined behaviour, but comparison is not included.</p>\n<p>So maybe it's undefined to compare singular iterators for equality, hence making [i, i) impossible to evaluate.</p>\n<p>This is also indicated by the fact that your runtime error happens inside a function named _Equal1().</p>\n<p>I think the standard is vague with respect to this, and I'm not at all sure it's a bug in Visual Studio 2012.</p>\n<p><a href=\"http://cplusplus.github.io/LWG/lwg-unresolved.html\" rel=\"nofollow\">http://cplusplus.github.io/LWG/lwg-unresolved.html</a> in the chapter \"1213.
