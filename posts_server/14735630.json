The description in the body of the issue only mentions prvalues being confused with temporary expressions (that actually decide whether lifetime of what they evaluate to is lengthened or not). But lvalue and xvalues are likewise confused with these in the Standard. An example where that happens in the context of <code>static_cast</code> is issue number #1568 (in which the use of \"temporary variable\" further confuses the matter). </p>\n<p>Actually, this: </p>\n<blockquote>\n<p id=\"so_14735630_14738884_0\">A temporary bound to a reference parameter in a function call (5.2.2) persists until the completion of the full-expression containing the call.</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>Contradicts the other rules in the same paragraph. Because the temporary is bound to <em>both</em> a reference parameter in a function call and to a local automatic reference variable. </p>\n", "OwnerUserId": "34509", "LastEditorUserId": "34509", "LastEditDate": "2013-02-06T21:26:40.910", "Id": "14738884", "Score": "7", "CreationDate": "2013-02-06T21:12:13.450", "LastActivityDate": "2013-02-06T21:26:40.910"}, "33986170": {"ParentId": "14735630", "CommentCount": "0", "Body": "<p>Probably I am a bit slow but to me it did not become clear what the resolution of this question is from reading the other answers.
