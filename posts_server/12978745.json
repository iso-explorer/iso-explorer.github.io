The second two bullets do not apply here.)</p>\n<p>In your program, there are two names <code>x</code>, which are the same.  They are declared in different scopes (in this case, they are declared in different translation units).  Both names have external linkage and both names refer to members of the same namespace (the global namespace).</p>\n<p>These two names <strong>do not</strong> denote the same variable.  The declaration <code>int x;</code> defines a variable.  Because there are two such definitions in the program, there are two variables in the program.  The name \"x\" in one translation unit denotes one of these variables; the name \"x\" in the other translation unit denotes the other.  Therefore, the program is ill-formed.</p>\n", "LastEditorUserId": "151292", "LastActivityDate": "2012-10-19T18:10:49.053", "Score": "11", "CreationDate": "2012-10-19T17:02:18.483", "ParentId": "12978745", "CommentCount": "12", "OwnerUserId": "151292", "LastEditDate": "2012-10-19T18:10:49.053"}, "12978941": {"Id": "12978941", "PostTypeId": "2", "Body": "<p>If standard does not say anything about definitions of unused variables then you can not imply that there may be multiple:</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p id=\"so_12978745_12978941_0\">Undefined behavior may also be expected when this International\n  Standard omits the description of any explicit definition of\n  behavior.</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>So it may compile and run nicely or may stop during translation with error message or may crash runtime etc. </p>\n<p>EDIT: See James McNellis answer the standard indeed actually has rules about it.</p>\n", "LastEditorUserId": "528720", "LastActivityDate": "2012-10-19T17:19:08.987", "Score": "1", "CreationDate": "2012-10-19T16:57:28.440", "ParentId": "12978745", "CommentCount": "2", "OwnerUserId": "528720", "LastEditDate": "2012-10-19T17:19:08.987"}, "12978881": {"Id": "12978881", "PostTypeId": "2", "Body": "<p>There is no error in compiling that, the error is in its linkage.
