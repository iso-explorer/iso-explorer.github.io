This is the only way that makes sense, since the relation of the virtual bases to tbe most-derived object is not known until object construction, at runtime (hence \"virtual\"). All intermediate initializers for virtual bases are ignored.</p>\n<p>So, what are your virtual bases? <code>G</code> derives from <code>E</code> and <code>F</code>. <code>E</code> derives virtually from <code>C</code>, which in turn derives virtually from <code>A</code>, so <code>A</code>, <code>C</code> are first. Next, <code>F</code> doesn't add any further virtual bases. Next, <code>E</code> has non-virtual bases <code>B</code> and <code>D</code>, in that order, which are constructed next, and then <code>E</code> is complete. Then comes <code>F</code>'s non-virtual base <code>D</code>, and <code>F</code> is complete. Finally, <code>G</code> is complete.</p>\n<p>All in all, it's virtual bases <code>A</code>, <code>C</code>, then non-virtual bases <code>B</code>, <code>D</code>, <code>E</code> and <code>D</code>, <code>F</code>, and then <code>G</code> itself.</p>\n", "OwnerUserId": "596781", "PostTypeId": "2", "Id": "21034129", "Score": "1", "CreationDate": "2014-01-10T00:34:59.630", "LastActivityDate": "2014-01-10T00:34:59.630"}, "bq_ids": {"n4140": {"so_21033845_21034121_1": {"section_id": 438, "quality": 0.7333333333333333, "length": 11}, "so_21033845_21034140_0": {"section_id": 438, "quality": 0.9518072289156626, "length": 79}, "so_21033845_21034121_0": {"section_id": 438, "quality": 0.75, "length": 6}}, "n3337": {"so_21033845_21034121_1": {"section_id": 429, "quality": 0.7333333333333333, "length": 11}, "so_21033845_21034140_0": {"section_id": 429, "quality": 0.9518072289156626, "length": 79}, "so_21033845_21034121_0": {"section_id": 429, "quality": 0.75, "length": 6}}, "n4659": {"so_21033845_21034121_1": {"section_id": 458, "quality": 0.7333333333333333, "length": 11}, "so_21033845_21034140_0": {"section_id": 458, "quality": 0.9518072289156626, "length": 79}, "so_21033845_21034121_0": {"section_id": 458, "quality": 0.75, "length": 6}}}, "21034121": {"ParentId": "21033845", "CommentCount": "0", "Body": "<p>You should follow the rules given in the C++ standard:</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p id=\"so_21033845_21034121_0\"><code>[C++11: 12.6.2/10]:</code> In a non-delegating constructor, initialization proceeds in the following order:</p>\n<ul>\n<li><strong>First, and only for the constructor of the most derived class (1.8), virtual base classes are initialized in the order they appear on a depth-first left-to-right traversal of the directed acyclic graph of base classes, where \u201cleft-to-right\u201d is the order of appearance of the base classes in the derived class <em>base-specifier-list</em>.</strong></li>\n<li><strong>Then, direct base classes are initialized in declaration order as they appear in the base-specifier-list (regardless of the order of the <em>mem-initializers</em>).</strong></li>\n<li>Then, non-static data members are initialized in the order they were declared in the class definition (again regardless of the order of the <em>mem-initializers</em>).</li>\n<li>Finally, the <em>compound-statement</em> of the constructor body is executed.</li>\n</ul>\n<p id=\"so_21033845_21034121_1\"><em>[ Note:</em> The declaration order is mandated to ensure that base and member subobjects are destroyed in the reverse order of initialization. <em>\u2014end note ]</em></p>\n</blockquote>\n", "OwnerUserId": "560648", "PostTypeId": "2", "Id": "21034121", "Score": "1", "CreationDate": "2014-01-10T00:34:00.487", "LastActivityDate": "2014-01-10T00:34:00.487"}});
