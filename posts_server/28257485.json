A class is abstract if it has <strong>at least\n  one</strong> <em>pure virtual function</em>. <em>[ Note:</em> Such a function might be inherited: see below. <em>\u2014end note ]</em></p>\n<pre><code>class point { / ... / };\nclass shape { // abstract class\n    point center;\npublic:\n    point where() { return center; }\n    void move(point p) { center=p; draw(); }\n    virtual void rotate(int) = 0; // pure virtual\n    virtual void draw() = 0; // pure virtual\n};\n</code></pre>\n</blockquote>\n<p>In the example, <code>shape</code> contains two pure virtual methods (which makes it an abstract class), but also contains two non-virtual methods. That is OK. So your original definition that an abstract class contains <em>only</em> pure virtual functions is too constricting. Just having at least one such is sufficient. </p>\n", "LastActivityDate": "2015-01-31T23:00:16.577"}, "28257485": {"CommentCount": "3", "AcceptedAnswerId": "28257514", "CreationDate": "2015-01-31T22:56:08.327", "LastActivityDate": "2015-01-31T23:00:16.577", "PostTypeId": "1", "ViewCount": "195", "FavoriteCount": "1", "Title": "Abstract base class definition", "Id": "28257485", "Score": "6", "Body": "<p>Can this be a definition of an abstract base class : \"contains only pure virtual methods and often serves as an interface specification for derived classes\"</p>\n<p>or can the abstract base class also contain other methods(also virtual)</p>\n", "Tags": "<c++>", "OwnerUserId": "4246363", "AnswerCount": "1"}, "bq_ids": {"n4140": {"so_28257485_28257514_0": {"section_id": 7019, "quality": 0.8529411764705882, "length": 29}}, "n3337": {"so_28257485_28257514_0": {"section_id": 6765, "quality": 0.8529411764705882, "length": 29}}, "n4659": {"so_28257485_28257514_0": {"section_id": 8516, "quality": 0.8529411764705882, "length": 29}}}});
