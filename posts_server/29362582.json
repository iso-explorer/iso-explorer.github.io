The CWG discussed this thoroughly. About the intent, Mike Miller mentions that</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p id=\"so_29362582_29363199_0\">The rationale for the current specification is really very simple:</p>\n<ul>\n<li><p id=\"so_29362582_29363199_1\">\u201cUnless redeclared in the derived class, members of a base class are also considered to be members of the derived class.\u201d (10\n  [class.derived] paragraph 2)</p></li>\n<li><p id=\"so_29362582_29363199_2\">In class scope, members hide nonmembers.</p></li>\n</ul>\n<p id=\"so_29362582_29363199_3\">That's it. Because template parameters are not members, they are\n  hidden by member names (whether inherited or not). I don't find that\n  \u201cbizarre,\u201d or even particularly surprising.</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>Rationale:</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p id=\"so_29362582_29363199_4\">We have some sympathy for a change, but the current rules fall straightforwardly out of the lookup rules, so they're not \u201cwrong.\u201d Making private members invisible also would solve this problem. We'd be willing to look at a paper proposing that.[..]<br><strong>The CWG decided not to consider a change to the existing rules at this time without a paper exploring the issue in more detail.</strong></br></p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>Unfortunately no such paper has been written yet, and so the rule persists until today.</p>\n", "LastEditorUserId": "3647361", "LastActivityDate": "2016-03-20T10:59:08.600", "Score": "7", "CreationDate": "2015-03-31T07:40:48.997", "ParentId": "29362582", "CommentCount": "2", "OwnerUserId": "3647361", "LastEditDate": "2016-03-20T10:59:08.600"}});
