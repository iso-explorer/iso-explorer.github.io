First, a null pointer constant is (<code>4.10/1</code>)</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p id=\"so_651361_651378_0\">A null pointer constant is an integral constant expression (5.19) rvalue of integer type that evaluates to zero. </p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>Then, what happens if we convert a null pointer constant to <code>bool</code>?

A zero value, null pointer value, or null member pointer value is converted to false; a</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>(When it talks about <code>rvalue</code> it essentially means a simple value as opposed to a variable of that type). </p>\n<p>Now, what actually <em>is</em> that <code>NULL</code>? Read <code>18.1/4</code> (note that in C, a null pointer constant is defined differently. Which might be the reason it explicitly refers to C++)</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p id=\"so_651361_651378_2\">The macro NULL is an implementation-defined C++ null pointer constant in this International Standard</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>The important bit of that combination is the part \"<code>A zero value ... is converted to false</code>\". An assignment of <code>NULL</code> to a bool variable will try to convert <code>NULL</code> to a boolean value. As the above passages say, such a conversion exist and can be done. </p>\n<p>Another important thing about null pointers to understand is the different between a <code>null pointer</code> and a <code>null pointer constant</code>. As we just read, a null pointer constant is some integer value that's zero. However, a <code>null pointer</code> and its value, a <code>null pointer value</code>, are pointers and their type is of pointer type. The following has type int and is a null pointer constant</p>\n<pre><code>#define NULL ('n'-'n') // looks suspicious, but conforms\n</code></pre>\n<p>Because it is a integral constant expression (that is essentially an integer value that is known at compile time) with value zero. The following is a null pointer value</p>\n<pre><code>(void*)NULL\n</code></pre>\n<p>but it is <em>not</em> a null pointer constant. But anyway, also null pointer <em>values</em> are converted to bool as the above quote tells: \"<code>A .. null pointer value .. is converted to false</code>\".
