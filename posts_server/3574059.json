If you use cast operators you're telling it \"trust me, I know what's there\", demanding it ignore it's own knowledge of the program.  It's precisely because the C-style casting operator you've used is dangerous and can be easily misused that C++ introduces static_cast, const_cast and reinterpret_cast, which communicate the programmer's intent in such a way that the compiler can still say \"hey, hold on there, that'd require more than just the type of leniency you're asking for\".  reinterpret_cast is the big daddy though... no arguing with that... just as brutal as the C-cast and rarely needed in a high-level application.  Precisely because it's rarely needed, verbose and easily seen, it draws scrutiny.  Code littered with C-style casts can easily hide bugs.</p>\n", "LastEditorUserId": "410767", "LastActivityDate": "2010-08-26T10:43:39.770", "Score": "3", "CreationDate": "2010-08-26T10:24:38.243", "ParentId": "3574059", "CommentCount": "1", "OwnerUserId": "410767", "LastEditDate": "2010-08-26T10:43:39.770"}});
