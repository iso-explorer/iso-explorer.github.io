The reason the iterator gets invalidated but the reference does not is that the iterator needs to be able to do <code>++</code> and <code>--</code> correctly, but pushing something onto a deque might cause it to rearrange its structures for tracking that.  But, deque guarantees it won't move the elements themselves, even if it has to restructure the container around them.</p>\n<p>This suggests that the implementation of deque has an additional level of indirection built into its iterators that it hides from you.  But, that's pretty much the entire the point of iterators, and why they're distinct from references.</p>\n", "LastActivityDate": "2013-07-07T21:14:33.043", "CommentCount": "0", "CreationDate": "2013-07-07T21:14:33.043", "ParentId": "17516311", "Score": "1", "OwnerUserId": "2354107"}, "17516311": {"ViewCount": "289", "Body": "<p>I followed the following post that illustrates the scenario how iterator behaves after some non-const operations. </p>\n<p><a href=\"https://stackoverflow.com/questions/6438086/iterator-invalidation-rules\">Iterator invalidation rules</a></p>\n<p>I have problems to understand the difference between <code>reference</code> and <code>iterator</code>.
