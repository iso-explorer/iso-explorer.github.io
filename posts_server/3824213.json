C++ guarantees that the order of objects in memory is the same as the order of declaration, unless an access qualifier intervenes.</p>\n<p>Objects which are directly adjacent are more likely to be on the same cacheline, so one memory access will fetch them both (or flush both from the cache). Cache effectiveness may also be improved as the proportion of useful data inside it may be higher. Simply put, spatial locality in your code translates to spatial locality for performance.</p>\n<p>Also, as Jerry notes in the comments, order may affect the amount of padding. Sort the members by decreasing size, which is also by decreasing alignment (usually treat an array as just one element of its type, and a member struct as its most-aligned member). Unnecessary padding may increase the total size of the structure, leading to higher memory traffic.</p>\n<p>C++03 \u00a79/12:</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p id=\"so_3824213_3824241_0\">Nonstatic data members of a\n  (non-union) class declared without an\n  intervening access-specifier are allocated so that later members have\n  higher addresses within a class\n  object.
