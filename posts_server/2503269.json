That works.</p>\n<p>But then it occurred to me that the only character I actually need to change is the third one, and that the original value would always be 0-3, so there would never be any \"carrying\" problems. It further occurred to me that the ASCII code points for the numbers are consecutive, so adding the number 4 to the character \"0\", for example, would result in \"4\", and so forth. So that's what I ended up doing.</p>\n<p>My question is, is there any reason that won't always work? I generally avoid \"ASCII arithmetic\" on the grounds that it's not cross-platform or internationalization friendly. But it seems reasonable to assume that the code points for numbers will always be sequential, i.e., \"4\" will always be 1 more than \"3\".
