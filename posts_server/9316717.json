Do void return types have this same undefined behavior, or is it only in the non-void returning function?  </p>\n<p>My concern is that this will just end up as a terrible coding style that isn\u2019t justified by anything.  However if it\u2019s also an undefined behavior for void return functions, then I can see the need for adding it to the coding standard.
