Issuing an arbitrary diagnostic (such as the <code>static_assert</code> failing) is valid compiler behavior.  Missing the problem is valid compiler behavior.  The behavior of a program compiled from an ill formed, no diagnostic required program is not defined by the standard: it is undefined behavior.

As a general rule, C++ wants to leave itself (and its compilers) freedom to find invalid template code \"earlier than instantiation\"; this means that template code must produce possibly legal code.</p>\n<p>It is possible you want something like <code>=delete</code> with a message attached.</p>\n", "LastEditorUserId": "1774667", "LastActivityDate": "2015-05-06T15:48:25.410", "Score": "9", "CreationDate": "2015-05-06T15:42:11.660", "ParentId": "30078818", "CommentCount": "5", "LastEditDate": "2015-05-06T15:48:25.410", "OwnerUserId": "1774667"}});
