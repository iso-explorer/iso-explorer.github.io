Just put 'class A;' into the header which tells the compiler (and linker) to figure out what A is at a later time. The only disadvantage to this is that file C no longer knows what's inside of A, so you have to use references or pointers.</p>\n<p>An alternative is just to split C into 2 parts. Is there a reason the enum in embedded inside it, and not part of B? If C and B share the enum definitions, then it should be split into a separate class, or just be an top-level enum by itself.</p>\n<p>When I get circular definitions like this, I double check what it is that I'm doing. I always find that I've made things a bit too complicated for myself.</p>\n", "LastActivityDate": "2012-02-11T14:45:28.413", "CommentCount": "0", "CreationDate": "2012-02-11T14:45:28.413", "ParentId": "9241007", "Score": "0", "OwnerUserId": "13744"}, "bq_ids": {"n4140": {"so_9241007_9241021_1": {"length": 19, "quality": 0.9047619047619048, "section_id": 5869}, "so_9241007_9241021_2": {"length": 15, "quality": 0.8333333333333334, "section_id": 5907}}, "n3337": {"so_9241007_9241021_1": {"length": 19, "quality": 0.9047619047619048, "section_id": 5640}, "so_9241007_9241021_2": {"length": 15, "quality": 0.8333333333333334, "section_id": 5679}}, "n4659": {"so_9241007_9241021_1": {"length": 19, "quality": 0.9047619047619048, "section_id": 7352}, "so_9241007_9241021_2": {"length": 13, "quality": 0.7222222222222222, "section_id": 7389}}}, "9241021": {"Id": "9241021", "PostTypeId": "2", "Body": "<blockquote>\n<p id=\"so_9241007_9241021_0\">I've tried some business with forward declarations but it didn't seem to work</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>You didn't show us what \"didn't seem to work\", or in what way it \"didn't seem to work\", but there is <em>one</em> place in your code where you can replace a full type definition with a forward declaration, and two where you can't.</p>\n<h3>Where you can't</h3>\n<p>Non-static data members must be of complete types:</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p id=\"so_9241007_9241021_1\"><code>[C++11: 9.2/10]:</code> Non-<code>static</code> (9.4) data members shall not have incomplete types.

Perhaps <code>C::EnumType</code> should instead be <code>B::EnumType</code>? Try to make your classes more self-contained. Forward declarations are all well and good, but life would be a lot easier if you solved the root problem of your design's tight coupling.</p>\n", "LastEditorUserId": "560648", "LastActivityDate": "2012-02-11T15:05:12.920", "Score": "2", "CreationDate": "2012-02-11T14:39:04.093", "ParentId": "9241007", "CommentCount": "14", "OwnerUserId": "560648", "LastEditDate": "2012-02-11T15:05:12.920"}, "9241007": {"ViewCount": "1441", "Body": "<p>I'm sure this is some design flaw on my part mainly because I come from a Java background.
