Undefined Behaviour?", "Id": "788482", "Score": "5", "Body": "<p>I saw some code as below during a peer-code-review session:</p>\n<pre><code>char *s = new char[3];\n*s++ = 'a';\n*s++ = 'b';\n*s++='\\0';\ndelete []s; // this may or may not crash on some or any day !!\n</code></pre>\n<p>Firstly, I know that in Standard C++, pointing to one-past the array-size is O.K. though accessing it results in undefined behaviour. So I believe the last line <code>*s++='\\0'</code> is fine. But if I recall correctly, the C++ standard mandates that <code>delete</code> should be supplied the same pointer that <code>new</code> returned. </p>\n<p>This I believe means that the returned pointer must not be tampered-with. I guess it is because <code>new</code> might keep some housekeeping info before the returned address that <code>delete</code> might use. Moving the <code>new</code>'d pointer might make this inaccessible.</p>\n<p>Is it undefined behaviour or implementation-defined or unspecified?\nCan anyone confirm this please? Preferably by pointing to the correct place in the C++ Standard.</p>\n<p><sub>In the freely available draft version of the draft C++ Standard (Draft_SC22-N-4411.pdf) has the details in section 5.3.5.
