The order of (dynamic) initialization of non-local objects is only defined within a translation unit, this is another reason why there has to be a definition including initializer for non-<code>const</code>, non-<code>constexpr</code> static data members.</p>\n<hr>\n<p>What's the point of this extra definition?</p>\n<p>This has already been answered in the comments IMO. You might want to add the ODR, that is, as a name with external linkage, the static data member must (only) be defined in one translation unit (if it's ODR-used). It's up to the programmer to choose this translation unit.</p>\n</hr>", "LastEditorUserId": "420683", "LastActivityDate": "2013-05-04T12:46:00.353", "Score": "6", "CreationDate": "2013-05-04T12:26:19.520", "ParentId": "16373831", "CommentCount": "0", "OwnerUserId": "420683", "LastEditDate": "2013-05-04T12:46:00.353"}});
