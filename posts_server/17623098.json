[ Note: A pair of pointers or a pointer plus\n  a length would be obvious representations for initializer_list.\n  initializer_list is used to implement initializer lists as specified\n  in 8.5.4.

It doesn't have value semantics, it has pointer semantics. Which is made obvious by the last portion of the quote: <em>Copying an initializer list does not copy the underlying elements.</em> Seeing as they were intended solely for the purpose of initializing things, I don't think it's that surprising that you don't get all the niceties of more <em>robust</em> containers such as tuples.</p>\n", "OwnerUserId": "583833", "PostTypeId": "2", "Id": "17623839", "Score": "3", "CreationDate": "2013-07-12T20:52:12.417", "LastActivityDate": "2013-07-12T20:52:12.417"}, "17623098": {"CommentCount": "10", "AcceptedAnswerId": "17623839", "CreationDate": "2013-07-12T20:01:27.317", "LastActivityDate": "2013-07-12T20:52:12.417", "PostTypeId": "1", "ViewCount": "293", "FavoriteCount": "3", "Title": "questions regarding the design of std::initializer_list", "Id": "17623098", "Score": "7", "Body": "<p>I have some questions regarding the design of <code>std::initializer_list</code>.\nI didn't find answers in <strong>[support.initlist]</strong>.</p>\n<p>Why does it have an explicitly defined default constructor?</p>\n<p>Why this constructor is not <code>constexpr</code>?</p>\n<p>Why the method <code>size()</code> is not <code>constexpr</code>?</p>\n<p>Why there's no traits giving the size of <code>initializer_list</code> (like specializing <code>std::tuple_size</code>)?</p>\n<p>Why it's not possible to statically access its elements (like specializing <code>std::get</code>)?</p>\n<p>What happens when <code>sizeof</code> is applied to <code>initializer_list</code>?</p>\n", "Tags": "<c++><c++11>", "OwnerUserId": "1003615", "AnswerCount": "1"}, "bq_ids": {"n4140": {"so_17623098_17623839_0": {"section_id": 6955, "quality": 0.8529411764705882, "length": 29}}, "n3337": {"so_17623098_17623839_0": {"section_id": 6702, "quality": 0.8529411764705882, "length": 29}}, "n4659": {"so_17623098_17623839_0": {"section_id": 8452, "quality": 0.8529411764705882, "length": 29}}}});
