Bjarne Stroutsturp in the <em>C++ Programming language</em>, in its edition of 1986, long before any standardization, suggests this. In most of his examples of his tutorial chapter,  <code>main()</code>  doesn't return a value, and on page 82 of this early edition, he states:  </p>\n<blockquote>\n<p id=\"so_39026390_39027129_2\">Conventionally, main() returns 0 if the program terminates normally\n  and non zero otherwise, so returning the number of errors\n  accomplishes this nicely</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p><strong><em>Additional remarks</em></strong></p>\n<p>In this book, the rule is however implicit from the examples and acompanying explanations; Stroustrup didn't state  explicitly a general unambiguous rule for <code>main()</code> nor didn't he mention it in his <em>The Design and evolution of C++</em> book of 1994. </p>\n<p>To be noted that in C89 the principle was still undefined behavior in absence of explicit return value, until arrival of C99.  But in C++98 the current 0 return by default rule was already formalized. So I think it's not for backward compatibility with C.</p>\n", "LastEditorUserId": "3723423", "LastActivityDate": "2016-08-18T21:32:52.340", "Score": "2", "CreationDate": "2016-08-18T20:40:39.950", "ParentId": "39026390", "CommentCount": "0", "OwnerUserId": "3723423", "LastEditDate": "2016-08-18T21:32:52.340"}});
