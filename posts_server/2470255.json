The <code>(*subxpression).x</code> expression only does one dereference on subexpression, so if the result of <code>(*subexpression)</code> is another pointer, then this wouldn't compile (you would need to write <code>(*(*subexpression)).x</code>. See the following code for a better illustration:</p>\n<pre><code>#include &lt;iostream&gt;\nusing namespace std;\n\nclass MyClass\n{\npublic:\n    MyClass() : x(0) {}\n    int x;\n};\n\nclass MyPtr\n{\nprivate:\n    MyClass* mObj;\npublic:\n    MyPtr(MyClass* obj) : mObj(obj) {}\n    MyClass* operator-&gt;() \n    {\n        return mObj;\n    }\n};\n\nint main() \n{\n    MyClass obj;\n    MyClass* objCPtr = &amp;obj;\n    MyClass** objCHandle = &amp;objCPtr;\n    MyPtr ptr(&amp;obj);\n    cout &lt;&lt; ptr-&gt;x &lt;&lt; endl;\n    cout &lt;&lt; (*(*objCHandle)).x &lt;&lt; endl;\n}\n</code></pre>\n<p>Note however, that this would not compile:</p>\n<pre><code>cout &lt;&lt; objCHandle-&gt;x &lt;&lt; endl;\n</code></pre>\n<p>Because the drill down behavior of -&gt; only occurs when the left hand side of the expression is a class, struct, union, or generic type. In this case, objCHandle is a MyClass**, so it doesn't qualify.</p>\n", "OwnerUserId": "278966", "LastEditorUserId": "24762", "LastEditDate": "2010-03-18T15:49:34.843", "Id": "2470586", "Score": "7", "CreationDate": "2010-03-18T14:32:48.717", "LastActivityDate": "2010-03-18T15:49:34.843"}, "2470834": {"ParentId": "2470255", "CommentCount": "1", "Body": "<p>Since you are asking for it in the comments.
