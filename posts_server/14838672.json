If <code>std::begin</code> and <code>std::end</code> are visible they might be used, but are not required.  Also, it would involve packaging up the loop body as a lambda so you have a function object to pass to <code>std::for_each</code>, which would complicate the specification of range-based <code>for</code>, which is supposed to have the same semantics and be exactly as efficient as a hand-written <code>for</code> loop.

But more importantly, range-based <code>for</code> allows other things besides <code>std::for_each</code>. As a language feature, you get to, for example, <em><code>break</code></em> out of the loop. You can use <code>goto</code> or other language constructs. And so forth.</p>\n<p><code>std::for_each</code> is based around calling a function for each iteration. And you can't really \"break\" out of a function.</p>\n", "LastEditorUserId": "734069", "LastActivityDate": "2013-02-12T21:03:26.620", "Score": "3", "CreationDate": "2013-02-12T18:39:31.620", "ParentId": "14838672", "CommentCount": "3", "OwnerUserId": "734069", "LastEditDate": "2013-02-12T21:03:26.620"}});
