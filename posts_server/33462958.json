They are member variables. But whoever gave you this assignment surely just wanted to make sure that you don't use global variables, so you'll be fine. It would be completely meaningless to give students an assignment with a <code>class</code> and forbid member variables.</p>\n<p><strong>Language-lawyer answer:</strong> Neither <em>\"global variable\"</em> nor <em>\"member variable\"</em> are official terminology. Believe it or not, but the entire ~1300-1400 PDF for the ISO C++ standard contains only 3 instances of \"member variable\" and 1 instance of \"global variable\" (I have searched in a draft PDF, but that doesn't make much of a difference).</p>\n<p>A local variable is described in the C++ standard at \u00a73.3.3/1 as follows:</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p id=\"so_33462958_33463344_1\">A variable declared at block scope is a <em>local variable</em>.</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>A global variable is officially called \"non-local variable\" (\u00a73.6.2). It's by definition the opposite of a local variable.</p>\n<p>A member variable is officially called a \"data member\", as evidenced in \u00a79.2/1:</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p id=\"so_33462958_33463344_2\">Members of a class are data members, member functions (...), nested\n  types, and enumerators.</p>\n</blockquote>\n", "LastActivityDate": "2015-11-01T14:39:57.673", "CommentCount": "0", "CreationDate": "2015-11-01T14:39:57.673", "ParentId": "33462958", "Score": "4", "OwnerUserId": "3313064"}, "33463084": {"Id": "33463084", "PostTypeId": "2", "Body": "<p>Global variables are things you can see and change from \"anywhere\" in the code, i.e, outside of any particular class.</p>\n<p>They are considered harmful, because when you change a global variable, you have to somehow know all the code that might look at it, in order to know what effects that change might have.
