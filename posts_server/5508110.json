They all have to guess at the programming language you used. As you probably already know, the PNG format is suitable for all programming languages, not just C++. </p>\n<p>Usually the compiler can figure out the language itself. For instance, if the PNG is obviously drawn with crayons, the compiler will know it contains Visual Basic. If it looks like it's drawn with a mechanical pencil, it's easy to recognize the engineer at work, writing FORTRAN code.</p>\n<p>This second step doesn't help the compiler either, in this case. C and C++ just look too similar, down to the <code>#include</code>. Therefore, you must help the compiler decide what language it really is. Now, you could use non-standard means. For instance, the Visual Studio compiler accepts the <a href=\"http://msdn.microsoft.com/en-us/library/032xwy55.aspx\">/TC and /TP</a> command-line arguments, or you could use the \"Compile as: C++\" option in the project file.

As you've discovered by now, C++ compilers are very picky about what they accept. Therefore the standard way to identify C++ is by the intimidation programmers add to their C++ code.
