A good programmer must consider two things: readability and maintainabilty. A blogger (I can't remember who) once said that a programmer doesn't program for computers, they should program for programmers.</p>\n<p>What this means is that you should try and make things as easy to read as possible. Condensing multiple lines into one actually decreases readabilty because the reader has to stop and think about more than one thing, they have to analyse the condensed statement instead of just reading it.</p>\n<p>What you want to do can also hide bugs created by typos. Say, for instance, you typed </p>\n<pre><code>function(val == 2)\n</code></pre>\n<p>by mistake. The compiler would allow this as well since it will convert a bool into an int. Another reader also won't pick up this mistake unless he/she knows the parameter list well. </p>\n<p>If you're interested in tips and tricks and advice on good programming construction techniques, I would highly recommend <a href=\"http://www.stevemcconnell.com/cc.htm\" rel=\"nofollow\">Code Complete 2</a>.
