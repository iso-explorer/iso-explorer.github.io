The rule <em>point-of-declaration</em> nicely is applicable on many situations. Now, I confused on usage of <code>auto</code> in combination of this rule.</p>\n<p>Consider these two codes:</p>\n<p>i. Declaring <code>x</code> by itself <em>(we don't expect it to work)</em>:</p>\n<pre><code>{\n  auto x = x;\n}\n</code></pre>\n<p>ii. Declaring the inner <code>x</code> by the outer <code>x</code> <em>(It makes error in gcc 4.8.x)</em>:</p>\n<pre><code>{\n  int x = 101; // the outer x\n  {\n    auto x = x; // the inner x\n  }\n}\n</code></pre>\n<p>According to the rule of point-of-declaration, it should work but it doesn't. It seems there is another rule in the standard that I missed it. The question is, <strong><em>Where is the point-of-declaration when using <code>auto</code>?</em></strong></p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>There are two possibilities:</p>\n<p>i. If the point of declaration is after <code>=</code>, at the end of statement:</p>\n<pre><code>auto object = expression;\n                        ^\n                        Is it here? If it is, why gcc complains?\n</code></pre>\n<p>So the second declaration is valid and must work, because there is no <code>x</code> but that outer one (which is declared before). Therefore <code>auto x=x</code> is valid and the inner <code>x</code> should be assigned to <code>101</code>.</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>ii. If the point of declaration is before <code>=</code> :</p>\n<pre><code>auto object = expression;\n           ^\n</code></pre>\n<p>Well, it doesn't make any sense because <code>auto</code> has to wait until see the following expression. For example <code>auto x;</code> is invalid.</p>\n<hr>\n<p><strong>Update</strong>: I need an answer which explains it by the rule <em>point of declaration</em>.</p>\n</hr>", "PostTypeId": "1", "ViewCount": "735", "FavoriteCount": "2", "Title": "Point of declaration for auto keyword", "Id": "19133452", "Score": "16", "CreationDate": "2013-10-02T09:05:37.927", "Tags": "<c++><c++11>", "OwnerUserId": "952747", "AnswerCount": "4"}, "19133758": {"ParentId": "19133452", "LastEditDate": "2013-10-02T09:40:04.007", "CommentCount": "0", "CreationDate": "2013-10-02T09:23:37.093", "LastEditorUserId": "85371", "PostTypeId": "2", "Id": "19133758", "Score": "4", "Body": "<p>Just adding an example with more explicit diagnostics:</p>\n<pre><code>auto ll = [&amp;] { ll(); };\n</code></pre>\n<p>Results in (gcc):</p>\n<pre><code>error: variable \u2018auto ll\u2019 with \u2018auto\u2019 type used in its own initializer\n</code></pre>\n<p>or (clang):</p>\n<pre><code>error: variable 'll' declared with 'auto' type cannot appear in its own initializer\n    auto ll = [&amp;] { ll(); };\n                    ^\n</code></pre>\n<p>You can see that there is an explicit rule for this.
