The exact definition is \npointer is a variable which can hold the address of a variable and if we de-reference(fetch the value) it, it will returns the value of the present on that address. If a pointer is fails to returns a value on dereferencing then it is not a pointer.\nYou can try that even in gcc compiler a simple variable can also hold the address of another variable but at dereference it will give you error.\nNow the size \nIrrespective of data types the size of pointer is always equal to the size of integer on that specific compiler. So the size of pointer in gcc compiler is 4bytes(size of integer) and in turboc its size is 2bytes(size of integer). \n  Now question is why equal to size of integer.\nWhat will be the address of any variable it may be int, char, float etc the address is always a whole integer number and where the whole integer number is stores in int. That's why the size of pointer is equal to the size of int because it also stores the address which is always a pure integer data.\n Then what is the difference between an int and char of any other data types pointer. At the time of retrieval your compiler will fetch the number of bytes according to your data types other wise you will get error or not an error but for you some unpredictable result but not for me.\nSame rule apply for increment and decrement the pointer it always increment and decrement according to pointer data types.\n The size of pointer doesn't depend on the data type and hence the reason that your link list come into picture because if you try to declare the structure inside same variable then you will get compile time error because your compiler doesn't the size of structure before its complete declaration but self referential pointer of same structure are allowed why? The only answer because the size of pointer doesn't depend the size of data type. If you any query then please ask me.\nThanks\nasif aftab  </p>\n", "LastActivityDate": "2013-12-05T20:04:02.593", "CommentCount": "9", "CreationDate": "2013-12-05T20:04:02.593", "ParentId": "20407747", "Score": "-5", "OwnerUserId": "2673577"}, "20407896": {"Id": "20407896", "PostTypeId": "2", "Body": "<p>So that it can perform arithmetic and other operations.\nConsider these two examples:</p>\n<pre><code>int* p; /* let the address of the memory location p pointing to be 1000*/\np++;\nprintf(\"%u\",p); /* prints 1004 since it is an integer pointer*/\n\n\nchar *p; /* let the address of the memory location p pointing to be 1000*/\np++;\nprintf(\"%u\",p); /* prints 1001 since it is an char pointer*/\n</code></pre>\n<p>I hope this helps you !</p>\n", "LastActivityDate": "2013-12-05T18:33:34.840", "CommentCount": "0", "CreationDate": "2013-12-05T18:33:34.840", "ParentId": "20407747", "Score": "3", "OwnerUserId": "2078385"}, "20407786": {"Id": "20407786", "PostTypeId": "2", "Body": "<p>One reason is in pointer arithmetic.
