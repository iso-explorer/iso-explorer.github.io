Any other function can return whatever they want. Main is special in that it is the entry point for your program and also the exit point. When your program starts main is called when it only ends once main returns. Watching the return code of the main function is I <em>think</em> a practice that is going out of style these days but you still see a lot of code returning things like -1 when an error occurs. Who's watching that error code? The OS most of the time.</p>\n", "LastActivityDate": "2013-07-07T21:45:22.913", "LastEditorUserId": "583833", "Id": "17516567", "CommentCount": "6", "CreationDate": "2013-07-07T21:29:10.357", "ParentId": "17516560", "Score": "8", "OwnerUserId": "583833", "LastEditDate": "2013-07-07T21:45:22.913"}});
