The meaning of such a conversion is implementation-defined, except that if an implementation supports conversions in both directions, converting a prvalue of one type to the other type and back, possibly with different cv- qualification, shall yield the original pointer value.</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>Here the behavior is well specified.</p>\n<h3>In the C standard</h3>\n<p>The C standard doesn't appear to contemplate the conversion from a function pointer to an object pointer.

Why so? </p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>Pointers to member functions need to indicate whether the function is virtual, and allow virtual dispatch (perhaps by specifying the index into the vtable, rather than the address of a specific function) if so. This makes them more complicated than just an address.</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p id=\"so_23149343_23149421_1\">And this isn't necessarily with member functions but any normal C functions as well, isn't?</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>Pointers to \"normal\" (non-member) functions may be converted to object pointers, but not portably.

Some platforms have more exotic memory architectures - for example, separate memory spaces for instructions and data - and the conversion may not be allowed on those platforms.</p>\n", "LastEditorUserId": "204847", "LastActivityDate": "2014-04-18T07:30:20.863", "Score": "13", "CreationDate": "2014-04-18T07:24:28.160", "ParentId": "23149343", "CommentCount": "5", "OwnerUserId": "204847", "LastEditDate": "2014-04-18T07:30:20.863"}});
