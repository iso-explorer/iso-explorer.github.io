Now, since Wrapper has a conversion operator, the call <code>operator-( Wrapper() )</code> will be inspected by overload resolution to find the best match - and overload resolution finds that there is a global operator function with parameter <code>MyClass const&amp;</code> (or similiar). Then it tries to convert the <code>Wrapper</code> prvalue to <code>MyClass const&amp;</code> and sees that there is a user-defined conversion sequence: One that uses the conversion operator to convert the Wrapper-object to a <code>MyClass</code> object, which then can be used to (copy-)initialize the reference.</p>\n<p>If the operator function is a member instead, there is a problem: A global function call of the form <code>operator-( Wrapper() )</code> does obviously not yield any viable functions. But the one that assumes the operator function is a member doesn't yield anything either - because <code>operator-</code> is not a member of <code>Wrapper</code>, therefore <code>Wrapper().operator-()</code> doesn't work and doesn't yield any viable functions either. </p>\n<p>Remember: A class with a conversion operator does not inherit the members of the target type. If you wanted that, you should have inherited <code>MyClass</code>.</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p id=\"so_24020132_24020803_1\">For a unary operator <code>@</code> with an operand of a type whose cv-unqualified\n  version is <code>T1</code> [...] three sets of candidate functions, designated\n  <em>member candidates</em>, <em>non-member candidates</em> and <em>built-in candidates</em>, are\n  constructed as follows:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>If T1 is a complete class type, the set of member candidates is the\n  result of the qualified lookup of <code>T1::operator@</code> (13.3.1.1.1);\n  otherwise, the set of member candidates is empty.</li>\n<li>The set of non-member candidates is the result of the unqualified lookup of\n  <code>operator@</code> in the context of the expression according to the usual\n  rules for name lookup in unqualified function calls (3.4.2) except\n  that all member functions are ignored.

It looks for the name <code>operator-</code> in the default namespace, in the class <code>Wrapper</code>, and the namespace where <code>Wrapper</code> is defined.
