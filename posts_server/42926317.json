To my understanding, the part that I quoted implies that any nested class inside <code>Outer</code> would have the same access rights as <code>foo()</code>, thus having the ability to access <code>Bob</code>'s members. </p>\n<p>It is also worth noting that the standard contains the following example (<strong>[class.friend]/2</strong>), note the usage of <code>A::B</code> in <code>Y</code>:</p>\n<pre><code>class A {\n    class B { };\n    friend class X;\n};\n\nstruct X : A::B {\n    // OK: A::B accessible to friend\n    A::B mx; // OK: A::B accessible to member of friend\n    class Y {\n        A::B my; // OK: A::B accessible to nested member of friend\n    };\n};\n</code></pre>\n", "LastEditorUserId": "1490355", "LastActivityDate": "2017-03-21T12:04:24.887", "Score": "3", "CreationDate": "2017-03-21T11:57:22.263", "ParentId": "42926317", "CommentCount": "3", "OwnerUserId": "1490355", "LastEditDate": "2017-03-21T12:04:24.887"}, "42926317": {"ViewCount": "70", "Body": "<p>The following code compiles on MSVC:</p>\n<pre><code>#include &lt;iostream&gt;\n\nclass Bob\n{        \n    int a;\n    friend class Outer;\n};\nclass Outer\n{      \n    class Inner\n    {\n        void f(Bob obj)\n        {\n            std::cout &lt;&lt; obj.a; //OK\n        }\n    };\n};\n</code></pre>\n<p>So it seems that if Outer is a friend of Bob, so is Inner, automatically.
