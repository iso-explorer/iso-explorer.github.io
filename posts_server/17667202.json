Push and pop aren't on the list, so you can't assume they're thread safe.</p>\n<p>I'd also add that even popping will actually write data -- when you pop an item from the container, the size of the container needs to be updated, so both pushing and popping do writing. When more than one thread does writing, you need to do something to ensure only one thread does it at a time.</p>\n<p>To summarize: sorry, but no.</p>\n", "LastActivityDate": "2013-07-16T03:07:09.953", "CommentCount": "0", "CreationDate": "2013-07-16T03:07:09.953", "ParentId": "17667202", "Score": "9", "OwnerUserId": "179910"}});
