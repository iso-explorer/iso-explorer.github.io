After overwriting it, you need to use a mutex / memory barrier instruction / atomic operation or something to trigger a sync with other cores.  In practice, your compiler will probably do this before calling any external functions (google Dave Butenhof's post on volatile's dubious utility in multi-threading), so if you thread does that soon afterwards anyway then it's not a major issue.

A compiler that optimizes such a thing will most probably go against the programmers intention (why would someone have a pointer to volatile otherwise) and so would probably contain a bug. Still, I have experienced compiler vendors that cited these paragraphs when they were faced with bugreports about their over-aggressive optimizations. In the end, <code>volatile</code> is inherent platform specific and you are supposed to double check the result anyway. </p>\n", "LastEditorUserId": "34509", "LastActivityDate": "2010-09-24T18:08:44.180", "Score": "2", "CreationDate": "2010-09-24T17:43:20.310", "ParentId": "3785798", "CommentCount": "1", "OwnerUserId": "34509", "LastEditDate": "2010-09-24T18:08:44.180"}, "3785798": {"ViewCount": "452", "Body": "<p>Here's the problem: <a href=\"https://stackoverflow.com/questions/3785366/how-to-ensure-that-compiler-optimizations-dont-introduce-a-security-risk\">your program temporarily uses some sensitive data and wants to erase it when it's no longer needed</a>.
