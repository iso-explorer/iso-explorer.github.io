My <code>run()</code> function is going to be a member function of the same class that is using <code>boost::thread</code> as the aggregate thread object.

However, if I can guarantee that all members of the object used by <code>run()</code> are initialized prior-to initialization of the boost thread, could this actually be considered safe?</p>\n<p>The only workaround I can think of that guarantees safety is to have a subclass that guarantees full construction of an object that can be used by the constructor of <code>Thread</code>:</p>\n<pre><code>class Thread {\npublic:\n  Thread(...) : m_impl(...), m_thread(&amp;ThreadImpl::run, &amp;m_impl) {}\n\nprivate:\n  class ThreadImpl {\n    ThreadImpl(...) { }\n    void run() { ... }\n  }\n\n  ThreadImpl m_impl;\n  boost::thread m_thread;\n};\n</code></pre>\n<p>Is there a common way to do this?
