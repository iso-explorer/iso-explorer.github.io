If the\n  virtual function call uses an explicit\n  class member access (5.2.5) and the\n  object-expression refers to the object\n  under construction or destruction but\n  its type is neither the constructor or\n  destructor\u2019s own class or one of its\n  bases, the result of the call is\n  undefined.</p>\n</blockquote>\n", "LastEditorUserId": "320726", "LastActivityDate": "2011-05-17T17:36:53.457", "Score": "1", "CreationDate": "2011-05-17T12:39:46.037", "ParentId": "6030763", "CommentCount": "4", "OwnerUserId": "320726", "LastEditDate": "2011-05-17T17:36:53.457"}, "6030763": {"ViewCount": "326", "Body": "<p>i have this code snippet</p>\n<pre><code>class Osoba{\n         Osoba(char* imie,int wiek){                         \n                     this-&gt;imie=new char[strlen(imie)+1];\n                     strcpy(this-&gt;imie,imie);\n                     this-&gt;wiek=wiek;\n                     cout&lt;&lt;\"Utworzono Osobe \"&lt;&lt;this-&gt;imie&lt;&lt;endl;\n         }\n         Osoba(Osoba&amp; x){\n                 Osoba(x.imie,x.wiek);\n         }\n[...]\n</code></pre>\n<p>and when i call the copy constructor it doesnt work (creates and destroyes object).</p>\n<p>Edit:\nif i use</p>\n<pre><code>         Osoba(Osoba&amp; x): Osoba(x.imie,x.wiek){\n</code></pre>\n<p>i get <code>type 'class Osoba' is not a direct base of 'Osoba'</code></p>\n<p>how is this done ?</p>\n", "AcceptedAnswerId": "6030880", "Title": "c++ self in initialisation list", "CreationDate": "2011-05-17T12:28:19.690", "Id": "6030763", "CommentCount": "3", "LastEditDate": "2011-05-17T12:31:41.283", "PostTypeId": "1", "LastEditorUserId": "78054", "LastActivityDate": "2011-05-17T17:36:53.457", "Score": "0", "OwnerUserId": "78054", "Tags": "<c++><initialization-list>", "AnswerCount": "4"}, "6030810": {"Id": "6030810", "PostTypeId": "2", "Body": "<p>First of all, the constructor is not just any method, you can't just use at as a mutator method. </p>\n<p>that said,\nAm I right in thinking that your class had two fields, imie and wiek?</p>\n<p>just do the init code again, this time with x.imie and x.wiek as input</p>\n", "LastActivityDate": "2011-05-17T12:33:06.130", "CommentCount": "0", "CreationDate": "2011-05-17T12:33:06.130", "ParentId": "6030763", "Score": "0", "OwnerUserId": "750186"}, "6030800": {"Id": "6030800", "PostTypeId": "2", "Body": "<p>You have to initialize the members of <code>Osoba</code>, the same way as you are doing in the other constructor.</p>\n<p>You can only reuse constructors (with other syntax) in C++2011.</p>\n", "LastActivityDate": "2011-05-17T12:32:10.953", "CommentCount": "0", "CreationDate": "2011-05-17T12:32:10.953", "ParentId": "6030763", "Score": "3", "OwnerUserId": "212063"}});
