Constructors are functions that are required to initialize the data members of a class (and to perform other crucial operations such as setting up VTABLE and defining a VPTR - if your class declaration has atleast one virtual function).</p>\n<p>At the time of a new object creation by copy constructor or copy-assignment operator (i.e, when creating an object from an existing object), the compiler-generated copy constructor would perform a mere shallow copy (plain bit-wise copy) of values of the data members (that could lead to a dangling-pointer situation - if your class has a pointer data member and you happen to create more than one reference/pointer to your class object, and then the object gets destroyed via one of those - due to some intentional/un-intentional reason, leading to a crash if you access those dangling pointer(s)). Hence its always advised to define your own copy constructor and copy assignment operator, and perform a 'deep copy' of your pointer whenever your class has a \"pointer data member\".</p>\n", "LastActivityDate": "2015-06-04T06:37:07.837"}});
