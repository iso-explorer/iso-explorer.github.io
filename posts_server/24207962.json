After a few of discussions I found that something seems not right. Here is the sample:</p>\n<pre><code>#include &lt;conio.h&gt;\n#include &lt;stdio.h&gt;\n#include &lt;iostream&gt;\n\n/*\nstruct A // Won't be compiled\n{\n    A(void) {};\n    A(const A &amp;) {};\n    A(A &amp;&amp;) = delete;\n};\n*/\n\nstruct A // Compiled but...\n{\n    A(void) {};\n    A(const A &amp;) = delete;\n    A(A &amp;&amp;) {};\n};\n\nA func(void)\n{\n    A temp;\n\n    return temp;// 'temp' is a named object, so it should be a lvalue and the A(const A &amp;) should have been invoked.\n    //return std::move(temp); // OK.\n}\n\nint main(void)\n{\n    func();\n\n    _getch();\n    return(0);\n}\n</code></pre>\n<p>It will be compiled (either by VC or by gcc)... But it looks wrong.</p>\n<p>The question is: Even any copy-deducing condition has been triggered, There seems no reason to let the 'A(const A &amp;)' be ignored, isn't it?</p>\n", "Tags": "<c++><return-value-optimization>", "OwnerUserId": "2848654", "AnswerCount": "1"}, "bq_ids": {"n4140": {"so_24207962_24208281_0": {"section_id": 481, "quality": 0.6896551724137931, "length": 20}}, "n3337": {"so_24207962_24208281_0": {"section_id": 472, "quality": 1.0, "length": 29}}, "n4659": {"so_24207962_24208281_0": {"section_id": 504, "quality": 0.5517241379310345, "length": 16}}}});
