Within the class <em>member-specification</em>, the class is regarded as complete within function bodies, default arguments, and <em>brace-or-equal-initializers</em> for non-static data members (including such things in nested classes). Otherwise it is regarded as incomplete within its own class <em>member-specification</em>.</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>For the class to be complete within function bodies then in general all declaration need to be parsed: without completely parsing all declaration you can't know if something that wasn't parsed would change the meaning.
