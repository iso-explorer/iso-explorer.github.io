They may have different interfaces, but they do the same thing.</p>\n<p>The second thing is that there was effectively no consensus by the standards committee on questions of exactly how <code>optional&lt;T&amp;&gt;</code> should behave.</p>\n<p>Consider the following:</p>\n<pre><code>optional&lt;T&amp;&gt; ot = ...;\nT t = ...;\not = t;\n</code></pre>\n<p>What should that last line do? Is it taking the object being referenced by <code>ot</code> and copy-assign to it, such that <code>*ot == t</code>?
