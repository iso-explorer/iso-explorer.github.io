From C++03 \u00a710.3/8:</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p id=\"so_10455131_10455390_0\">A virtual function declared in a class shall be defined, or declared pure (10.4) in that class, or both; but no diagnostic is required (3.2).</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>So you need to either declare it pure (with the <code>= 0</code> suffix after the right parenthesis) or define its implementation.</p>\n<p>As for why you don't get an error when you don't call the function in the non-virtual case, refer to C++03 \u00a73.2/2-3 (emphasis mine)</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p id=\"so_10455131_10455390_1\">2) An expression is <em>potentially evaluated</em> unless it appears where an integral constant expression is required\n  (see 5.19), is the operand of the <code>sizeof</code> operator (5.3.3), or is the operand of the <code>typeid</code> operator and\n  the expression does not designate an lvalue of polymorphic class type (5.2.8). An object or non-overloaded\n  function is <em>used</em> if its name appears in a potentially-evaluated expression. <strong>A virtual member function is\n  used if it is not pure.</strong> [...]</p>\n<p id=\"so_10455131_10455390_2\">3) Every program shall contain <strong>exactly one definition of every non-inline function or object that is used</strong> in that\n  program; no diagnostic required. The definition can appear explicitly in the program, it can be found in the\n  standard or a user-defined library, or (when appropriate) it is implicitly defined (see 12.1, 12.4 and 12.8).\n  An inline function shall be defined in every translation unit in which it is used.</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>So, in the non-virtual case, if it's not used, a definition is not required.  But in the non-pure virtual case, even if it's not explicitly referenced in code, it's still considered to be used by the standard, so its definition is required.</p>\n<p>See also <a href=\"https://stackoverflow.com/questions/4145915/a-virtual-member-function-is-used-if-it-is-not-pure\">A virtual member function is used if it is not pure?</a>.</p>\n", "LastEditorUserId": "-1", "LastActivityDate": "2012-05-04T20:02:26.653", "Score": "2", "CreationDate": "2012-05-04T20:02:26.653", "ParentId": "10455131", "CommentCount": "0", "OwnerUserId": "9530", "LastEditDate": "2017-05-23T10:08:57.170"}, "10455195": {"Id": "10455195", "PostTypeId": "2", "Body": "<p>Every non-pure virtual function needs to be implemented.</p>\n<pre><code>class A \n{ \n   public: void rat(); \n};\n\nint main(int argc, char **argv) \n{ \n  A a; \n}\n</code></pre>\n<p>The above code is altogether a different scenario.
