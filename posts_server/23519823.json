I need to have a small piece of code run before a module's <code>main()</code> is invoked. I've had success putting the code in the constructor of a dummy class, then declaring one static variable of that class, eg:</p>\n<pre><code>namespace {\nclass Dummy {\npublic:\n    Dummy() { /* do work here */ }\n};\n\n   Dummy theDummy;\n}\n\nvoid main() {...}\n</code></pre>\n<p>This seems to work well, but is it a valid solution in terms of the compiler guaranteeing the code will run? Is there any chance it could detect that <code>theDummy</code> is not referenced anywhere else in the system and compile/link it away completely, or will it realise that the constructor needs to run?
