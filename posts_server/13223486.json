The idea is that you register classes with tags into a map as a sort of template, then call the cloneNew method of the shared base class to actually create the object that you want. However when I try to use a va_list to implement this functionality I get weird results. The problem code is:</p>\n<pre><code>GameObject* SphereObstacle::cloneNew(const Vector&amp; position, double charge, const Vector&amp;         dipole, ...)\n{\n    va_list v1;\n    va_start(v1, dipole);\n    double radius = va_arg(v1, double);\n    va_end(v1);\n    return new SphereObstacle(position, charge, dipole, radius);\n}\n</code></pre>\n<p>Every time I try to read from the va_list it returns a value that is huge. It almost seems like its a pointer. My only thought is that the issue is caused by the fact that this is an implementation of a virtual method in the base class, but I haven't found anything online to suggest that that is the issue. What is it that I am doing wrong?</p>\n", "AcceptedAnswerId": "13223529", "Title": "C++ va_list returning odd values", "CreationDate": "2012-11-04T22:14:57.173", "Id": "13223486", "CommentCount": "0", "PostTypeId": "1", "LastActivityDate": "2012-11-06T07:34:43.273", "Score": "0", "OwnerUserId": "894333", "Tags": "<c++>", "AnswerCount": "2"}});
