(see edit: it might be guaranteed, but the standard is unclear enough that I would avoid relying on it)</p>\n<p>The lifetime of exceptions is ruled by <strong>\u00a715.1 [except.throw]</strong>, and specifically:</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p id=\"so_21720579_21722226_0\">4/ The memory for the exception object is allocated in an unspecified way, except as noted in \u00a73.7.4.1. If a handler exits by rethrowing, control is passed to another handler for the same exception. <strong>The exception object is destroyed after either the last remaining active handler for the exception exits by any means other than rethrowing, or the last object of type <code>std::exception_ptr</code> (\u00a718.8.5) that refers to the exception object is destroyed, whichever is later.</strong> In the former case, the destruction occurs when the handler exits, immediately after the destruction of the object declared in the <em>exception-declaration</em> in the handler, if any. In the latter case, the destruction occurs before the destructor of <code>std::exception_ptr</code> returns. The implementation may then deallocate the memory for the exception object; any such deallocation is done in an unspecified way. [ <em>Note:</em> a thrown exception does not propagate to other threads unless caught, stored, and rethrown using appropriate library functions; see \u00a718.8.5 and \u00a730.6. <em>\u2014end note</em> ]</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>However, you also need to take into account the previous paragraph:</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p id=\"so_21720579_21722226_1\">3/ Throwing an exception copy-initializes (\u00a78.5, \u00a712.8) a temporary object, called the exception object. The temporary is an lvalue and is used to initialize the variable named in the matching handler (\u00a715.3). [...]</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>Thus, what happens in your case:</p>\n<ul>\n<li><code>eptr</code> is initialized to point to the current exception in flight, guaranteeing this exception lives at least as long as it does</li>\n<li><code>ex</code> is initialized to reference <strong>a copy</strong> of the exception pointed to by <code>eptr</code></li>\n<li>when the catch clause ends, <strong>the copy</strong> dies</li>\n<li><code>msg</code> was pointing into the copy, and thus is left dangling... unless both copy and original shared the same message under the covers.</li>\n</ul>\n<p>The only way to guarantee that an exception lives long enough for your purpose is to create a <code>std::exception_ptr</code>, directly.</p>\n<p><strong>EDIT</strong> Ralph Tandetzky brough to my attention that <strong>\u00a718.8.5 [propagation]</strong> says:</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p id=\"so_21720579_21722226_2\">7/ [...] [ <em>Note:</em> if <code>rethrow_exception</code> rethrows the same exception object (rather than a copy), concurrent access to that rethrown exception object may introduce a data race.
