According to another SO answer (\n<a href=\"https://stackoverflow.com/questions/1410563/what-is-the-difference-between-a-definition-and-a-declaration\">What is the difference between a definition and a declaration?</a> ), the following would be a class DEFINITION:</p>\n<pre><code>    class MyClass {\n        private:\n        public:\n    };\n</code></pre>\n<p>If the above definition is in a header file. Then , presumably, you can have multiple .cpp files that #include that header.  This means the class is defined multiple times after compilation in multiple .o files, but doesn't seem to cause much problems...</p>\n<p>On the other hand, if it was a function being defined in the header file, it would cause problems apparently...from what I understand... mayb?</p>\n<p>So what's so special about class definitions?</p>\n", "AcceptedAnswerId": "14654428", "Title": "Why is there no multiple definition error when you define a class in a header file?", "CreationDate": "2013-02-01T20:23:27.710", "Id": "14654377", "CommentCount": "2", "FavoriteCount": "2", "PostTypeId": "1", "LastEditDate": "2017-05-23T12:25:05.283", "LastEditorUserId": "-1", "LastActivityDate": "2013-02-01T20:34:10.393", "Score": "7", "OwnerUserId": "2033761", "Tags": "<c++><linker><header-files>", "AnswerCount": "3"}, "bq_ids": {"n4140": {"so_14654377_14654428_2": {"length": 10, "quality": 1.0, "section_id": 7041}, "so_14654377_14654428_0": {"length": 14, "quality": 1.0, "section_id": 7038}}, "n3337": {"so_14654377_14654428_2": {"length": 10, "quality": 1.0, "section_id": 6786}, "so_14654377_14654428_0": {"length": 14, "quality": 1.0, "section_id": 6784}}, "n4659": {"so_14654377_14654428_2": {"length": 10, "quality": 1.0, "section_id": 8538}, "so_14654377_14654428_0": {"length": 14, "quality": 1.0, "section_id": 8535}}}, "14654428": {"Id": "14654428", "PostTypeId": "2", "Body": "<p>The <strong>one-definition rule</strong> (3.2, [basic.def.odr]) applies differently to classes and functions:</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p id=\"so_14654377_14654428_0\">1 - No translation unit shall contain more than one definition of any variable, function, class type, enumeration type, or template.</p>\n<p id=\"so_14654377_14654428_1\">[...]</p>\n<p id=\"so_14654377_14654428_2\">4 - Every program shall contain exactly one definition of every non-inline function or variable that is odr-used in that program [...]</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>So while (non-inline) functions may be defined at most once in the whole program (and exactly once if they are called or otherwise odr-used), classes may be defined as many times as you have translation units (source files), but no more than once per translation unit.</p>\n<p>The <em>reason</em> for this is that since classes are types, their definitions are necessary to be able to share data between translation units.
