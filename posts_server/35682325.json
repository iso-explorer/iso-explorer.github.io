This time is stored as a single 64-bit integer.</p>\n<p>Now, in the same system, there is also a time in nano-seconds, but it's stored as a 128-bit integer. The resulting time-calculations are slightly more complex due to this large integer format, and for someone that only needs 1s precision for their time (in a system where a large number of calculations on time are made), you wouldn't want to have the extra penalty of using <code>high_precision_clock</code>, when the system doesn't need it.</p>\n<p>As to if there are such things in real life, I'm not sure. The key is that it's not a violation to the standard, if you care to implement it such.</p>\n<p>Note that steady is very much a property of \"what happens when the system changes time\" (e.g. if the outside network has been down for a several days, and the internal clock in the system has drifted off from the atomic clock that the network time updates to). Using <code>steady_clock</code> will guarantee that time doesn't go backwards or suddenly jumps forward 25 seconds all of a sudden. Likewise, there is no problem when there is a \"leap second\" or similar time adjustment in the computer system. On the other hand, a <code>system_clock</code> is guaranteed to give you the correct new time if you give it a forward duration past a daylight savings time, or some such, where <code>steady_clock</code> will just tick along hour after hour, regardless. So choosing the right one of those will affect the recording of your favourite program in the digital TV recorder - <code>steady_clock</code> will record at the wrong time [my DTV recorder did this wrong a few years back, but they appear to have fixed it now].</p>\n<p><code>system_clock</code> should also take into account the user (or sysadmin) changing the clock in the system, <code>steady_clock</code> should NOT do so.</p>\n<p>Again, <code>high_resolution_clock</code> may or may not be <code>steady</code> - it's up to the implementor of the C++ library to give the appropriate response to <code>is_steady</code>. </p>\n<p>In the 4.9.2 version of <code>&lt;chrono&gt;</code>, we find this <code>using high_resolution_clock = system_clock;</code>, so in this case it's a direct <code>typedef</code> (by a different name). But the spec doesn't REQUIRE this.</p>\n", "LastEditorUserId": "1919155", "LastActivityDate": "2016-02-28T14:10:35.690", "Score": "4", "CreationDate": "2016-02-28T14:03:58.080", "ParentId": "35682325", "CommentCount": "4", "OwnerUserId": "1919155", "LastEditDate": "2016-02-28T14:10:35.690"}, "35682325": {"ViewCount": "127", "Body": "<p>The C++ Draft par <em>20.12.7.3</em> reads: </p>\n<blockquote>\n<p id=\"so_35682325_35682325_0\"><code>high_resolution_clock</code> may be a synonym for <code>system_clock</code> or <code>steady_clock</code></p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>Of course this <strong>may</strong> mandates nothing but I wonder :</p>\n<ul>\n<li>Is there any point for <code>high_resolution_clock</code> to something other that a typedef ?</li>\n<li>Are there such implementations ? </li>\n<li>If a clock with a shorter tick period is devised it can either be steady or not steady.
