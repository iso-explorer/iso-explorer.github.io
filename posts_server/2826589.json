post_cb({"2826753": {"Id": "2826753", "PostTypeId": "2", "Body": "<p>C++ does not allow an object of size zero, because every object must have a unique memory address.  So if you have:</p>\n<pre><code>struct empty {};\n\n// ...\n\nempty myempty;\nempty* ptr = &amp;myempty;\n</code></pre>\n<p>then <code>ptr</code> must be pointing to a unique memory address.  The standard states the minimum size for an object is 1 byte for this purpose.  Similarly, allocations of size 0 are allowed, and return a valid pointer, even if writing to that pointer is not allowed (this works for <code>malloc(0)</code>, and <code>new empty</code> returns a pointer to one byte, since <code>sizeof(empty) == 1</code>).</p>\n<p>If I derive from <code>empty</code> like so:</p>\n<pre><code>struct derived : public empty\n{\n    int data;\n}\n</code></pre>\n<p>There is no longer any point in the base class <code>empty</code> occupying one byte, because all <code>derived</code> will have a unique address due to the <code>data</code> member.  The quote \"Base class subobjects may have zero size\" is present to allow, in this case, for the compiler to not use any space for <code>empty</code>, such that <code>sizeof(derived) == 4</code>.  As the title states, it's just an optimization, and it is perfectly legal for the <code>empty</code> part of <code>derived</code> to occupy zero space.</p>\n", "LastActivityDate": "2010-05-13T12:35:27.880", "CommentCount": "2", "CreationDate": "2010-05-13T12:35:27.880", "ParentId": "2826589", "Score": "9", "OwnerUserId": "177222"}, "bq_ids": {"n4140": {"so_2826589_2826863_0": {"length": 28, "quality": 0.9655172413793104, "section_id": 5794}, "so_2826589_2826589_1": {"length": 7, "quality": 1.0, "section_id": 5794}}, "n3337": {"so_2826589_2826863_0": {"length": 28, "quality": 0.9655172413793104, "section_id": 5567}, "so_2826589_2826589_1": {"length": 7, "quality": 1.0, "section_id": 5567}}, "n4659": {"so_2826589_2826863_0": {"length": 28, "quality": 0.9655172413793104, "section_id": 7253}, "so_2826589_2826589_1": {"length": 7, "quality": 1.0, "section_id": 7253}}}, "2826757": {"Id": "2826757", "PostTypeId": "2", "Body": "<p>A philosophical argument over the definition of \"region\" is unnecessary.</p>\n<p>1.8/5 says, \"Unless it is a bit-field, a most derived object shall have a non-zero size ...
