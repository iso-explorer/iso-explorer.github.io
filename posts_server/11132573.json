[emphasis added]</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>Unfortunately, the rest of your question can't be answered without discussing how to decide which specialization to use during instantiation. Here's the text from the standard (continuing from the excerpt above):</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p id=\"so_11132573_11132910_1\">This is done by matching the template arguments of the class template specialization with the template argument lists of the partial specializations.</p>\n<ul>\n<li>If exactly one matching specialization is found, the instantiation is generated from that specialization.</li>\n<li>If more than one matching specialization is found, the partial order rules (14.5.4.2) are used to determine whether one of the specializations is more specialized than the others. If none of the specializations is more specialized than all of the other matching specializations, then the use of the class template is ambiguous and the program is ill-formed.</li>\n</ul>\n</blockquote>\n<p>So, it never even attempts to compare the templates directly to each other at all. Rather, it attempts to find a specialization that will match the arguments given. If more than one matches, it attempts to pick the most specialized one based on the partial ordering rules. If neither is more specialized than the other, then the instantiation is ambiguous, and compilation fails.</p>\n<p>Now, it's certainly true that neither of these specializations could ever be used, since there would always be ambiguity -- if either matches, the other obviously matches equally well. There's simply no requirement for the compiler to detect or diagnose that though. In this exact case (essentially identical specializations) that would probably be easy, but there are almost certainly other cases where it would be much more difficult, so (apparently) the committee decided the compiler didn't even have to try.</p>\n", "LastEditorUserId": "179910", "LastActivityDate": "2012-06-21T06:52:22.303", "Score": "5", "CreationDate": "2012-06-21T06:47:14.333", "ParentId": "11132573", "CommentCount": "3", "LastEditDate": "2012-06-21T06:52:22.303", "OwnerUserId": "179910"}, "11132573": {"ViewCount": "284", "Body": "<p>What is the procedure of comparing the class <code>template</code> specializations?
