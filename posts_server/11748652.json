The C++ standard does not require a diagnostic for this particular error, which means your particular compiler is not obliged to notice that p is NULL or to give an error message, but it's still illegal. The C++ language also does not require the compiler to generate code that would blow up at runtime.</p>\n</blockquote>\n", "OwnerUserId": "1213473", "LastEditorUserId": "1025391", "LastEditDate": "2012-07-31T20:54:04.203", "Id": "11748762", "Score": "4", "CreationDate": "2012-07-31T20:47:56.370", "LastActivityDate": "2012-07-31T20:54:04.203"}, "11748735": {"ParentId": "11748652", "CommentCount": "2", "Body": "<p>No. ptr is a pointer that has an address.
