The compiler itself doesn't care if you include definitions from headers or not. I don't suggest to do this for productive programming but to understand why the compiler traditionally doesn't care about completeness of definitions. Most real-world compilation units are often incomplete. </p>\n", "LastEditorUserId": "2932052", "LastActivityDate": "2017-08-31T08:01:30.340", "Score": "1", "CreationDate": "2017-08-31T07:18:45.713", "ParentId": "45975114", "CommentCount": "0", "OwnerUserId": "2932052", "LastEditDate": "2017-08-31T08:01:30.340"}, "45975183": {"Id": "45975183", "PostTypeId": "2", "Body": "<p>Because the compiler (the entire translation process, actually) doesn't <em>have</em> to enforce anything if you perform an ODR<sup>1</sup> violation.
