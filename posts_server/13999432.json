The C++ standard has the following to say about this:</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p id=\"so_13999432_14000704_0\"><strong>30.3.1.3</strong>    thread destructor    [thread.thread.destr]</p>\n<p id=\"so_13999432_14000704_1\">~thread();</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p id=\"so_13999432_14000704_3\">If <strong>joinable()</strong> then terminate(), otherwise no effects. [ <strong>Note:</strong> Either\n    implicitly detaching or joining a <strong>joinable()</strong> thread in its destructor\n    could result in difficult to debug correctness (for detach) or\n    performance (for join) bugs encountered only when an exception is\n    raised. Thus the programmer must ensure that the destructor is never\n    executed while the thread is still joinable. \u2014 <em>end note</em> ]</p>\n</blockquote>\n</blockquote>\n<p>What this means is that you should not let threads go out of scope without first calling either <code>join()</code> or <code>detach()</code>.</p>\n<p>The way you describe it, you want the thread to go out of scope without joining so it will continue to run as your application runs. That requires a call to <code>detach()</code>. From there, I can only offer a little wisdom...</p>\n<ul>\n<li><p>That thread is now completely responsible for its own lifetime.
