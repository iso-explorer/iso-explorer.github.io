Any single UTF-8 value can be held in an 8-bit <code>char</code> (though one Unicode code-point can take several <code>char</code> values to represent).

UTF-32 and UCS-4 have the useful property that every possible displayed character is represented by one value, so you can tell the length of the string from how much memory it takes up without having to look at the values in it (though this assumes that you consider combining diacretic marks as separate characters).

The standard didn't specify how big a <code>wchar_t</code> is, so, of course, different compilers have picked different sizes; VC++ used two bytes and gcc (and most others) use four bytes.  Wide-character literals, such as <code>L\"Hello, world,\"</code> are similarly confused, being UTF-16 strings in VC++ and UCS-4 in gcc.</p>\n<p>To try to clean this up, C++11 introduced two new character types:</p>\n<ul>\n<li><code>char16_t</code> is a character guaranteed to be 16-bits, and with a literal form <code>u\"Hello, world.\"</code></li>\n<li><code>char32_t</code> is a character guaranteed to be 32-bits, and with a literal form <code>U\"Hello, world.\"</code></li>\n</ul>\n<p>However, these have problems of their own; in particular, <code>&lt;iostream&gt;</code> doesn't provide console streams that can handle them (ie there is no <code>u16cout</code> or <code>u32cerr</code>).</p>\n", "LastEditorUserId": "274460", "LastActivityDate": "2014-10-13T06:40:21.860", "Score": "1", "CreationDate": "2014-10-13T06:24:23.570", "ParentId": "26333381", "CommentCount": "0", "OwnerUserId": "274460", "LastEditDate": "2014-10-13T06:40:21.860"}});
