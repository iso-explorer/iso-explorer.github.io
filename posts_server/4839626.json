You can use boost::array to make them behave more like Java arrays, but keep in mind that you will still have value semantics rather than reference semantics, just like with everything else. (In particular, this means that you cannot really declare a variable of type analogous to <code>Foo[]</code> in Java, nor replace an array with another one of a different size; the array size is a part of the type.) Use <code>.size()</code> with this class where you would use <code>.length</code> in Java.
