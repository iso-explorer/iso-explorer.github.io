As the description says, it's typically implemented using Red-Black Tree(RBT), but the compiler writers have the option to violate this, but usually the would stick to the Theme of RBT since any other implementation won't be resource efficient to achieve the task of <code>set</code>.</p>\n", "LastActivityDate": "2012-01-12T11:04:47.697", "CommentCount": "0", "CreationDate": "2012-01-12T11:04:47.697", "ParentId": "8833938", "Score": "1", "OwnerUserId": "326820"}, "41424755": {"Id": "41424755", "PostTypeId": "2", "Body": "<p><strong>C++11 N3337 standard draft</strong> <a href=\"http://www.open-std.org/jtc1/sc22/wg21/docs/papers/2012/n3337.pdf\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">http://www.open-std.org/jtc1/sc22/wg21/docs/papers/2012/n3337.pdf</a> </p>\n<p>23.2.4 \"Associative containers\" says:</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p id=\"so_8833938_41424755_0\">1 Associative containers provide fast retrieval of data based on keys.
