The compiler sees it is a <em>static member</em> and ignores the pointer and goes straight for the single (per thread in this case) <code>static</code> instance. The whole <code>thread_local</code> business is actually irrelevant to that.</p>\n<p>So when you are accessing a <em>static member</em> of <code>A</code> through <code>A* a</code> in your <em>lambda</em>, the compiler is ignoring the <em>address</em> you gave it and doing <code>A::i</code> regardless (getting its own <code>thread_local</code> version).</p>\n<pre><code>struct A\n{\n    static int i;\n};\n\nA* a = new A;\na-&gt;i; // identical to A::i (because i is static)\n</code></pre>\n<p>This is standard syntax as mentioned here in the <strong>C++14 Standard</strong>:</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p id=\"so_39557407_39557478_0\"><strong>5.2.5</strong> Class member access <strong>[</strong> expr.ref <strong>]</strong></p>\n<p id=\"so_39557407_39557478_1\"><strong>1.</strong> A postfix expression followed by a dot . or an arrow -&gt;, optionally followed by the keyword template (14.2),\n  and then followed by an id-expression, is a postfix expression.
