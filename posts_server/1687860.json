I guess that either this is a bug or there's some large set of code (or small set of important code) that needs it outside of the <code>std</code> namespace. I'd have thought they'd use some preprocessor magic to make it so you could force it to be in the <code>std</code> namespace if desired (or the other way around - make it in <code>std</code> by default and allow a macro or something to force it to the global namespace).</p>\n<p>However, one additional wrinkle for <code>type_info</code> is that it's the result of the <code>typeid</code> operator (more precisely, something derived from <code>type_info</code> is the result), so there's probably a tight dependency on what the compiler does for the <code>typeid</code> operator that the library  needs to be in line with. So the fact that <code>type_info</code> isn't in namespace <code>std</code> is possibly due to what the compiler does with <code>typeid</code> expressions, and the library writers probably have little direct control over that (and I'd guess that's one reason why there's no preprocssor workaround for the problem). Someone who knows a lot more about how compilers work than I do would have to explain this better (or take it beyond speculation).</p>\n<p>But I think you'll have to ask someone at Microsoft (or PJ Plauger/Dinkumware) for a real answer to \"why\".</p>\n", "LastEditorUserId": "12711", "LastActivityDate": "2009-11-06T15:35:37.430", "Score": "3", "CreationDate": "2009-11-06T14:59:51.513", "ParentId": "1687860", "CommentCount": "3", "LastEditDate": "2009-11-06T15:35:37.430", "OwnerUserId": "12711"}, "1687931": {"Id": "1687931", "PostTypeId": "2", "Body": "<p>Because Visual Studio does all sorts of tricks to allow for legacy code to work.
