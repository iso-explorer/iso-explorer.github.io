There is absolutely no need to default initialze a member when it is not needed. This is why C/C++ never initializes built-in types as members or automatic variables - because doing so would impede performance. Of course, it is not a problem when you create your object/variable once (that's why statics are default-initialized), but for something happening in a tight loop default initialization might eat valuable nanoseconds.</p>\n<p>The one exception to this rule would, in my view, be pointers (if you happen to have raw pointers in your code).
