This defect report clarifies the equivalency of dependent names, and at the same time clarifies that a dependent name must be an <em>unqualified-id</em>. Formerly, in C++11, dependent names could be arbitrary <em>id-expression</em>s.</p>\n<p>This means that <em>qualified-id</em> names are no longer dependent names, and are therefore looked up according to \u00a714.6.3 [temp.nondep]. This doesn't actually affect program behaviour from C++11, since dependent names only affect whether ADL (\u00a73.4.2) is performed with the template instantiation context, and only <em>unqualified-id</em>s are eligible for ADL anyway.</p>\n", "LastActivityDate": "2014-11-10T02:03:51.370"}, "26835352": {"CommentCount": "3", "CreationDate": "2014-11-10T01:19:57.943", "PostTypeId": "1", "AcceptedAnswerId": "26835622", "LastEditorUserId": "1505939", "LastActivityDate": "2014-11-10T02:24:36.847", "LastEditDate": "2014-11-10T02:24:36.847", "ViewCount": "177", "FavoriteCount": "1", "Title": "Dependent qualified name lookup in C++14", "Id": "26835352", "Score": "4", "Body": "<p>This is about dependent name lookup in a template function, for example:</p>\n<pre><code>template&lt;class T&gt;\nvoid foo(T const &amp;t)\n{\n    ::func(t);\n}\n</code></pre>\n<p>In this code, <code>func</code> is a dependent name because it has a type-dependent expression as argument to a function call.
