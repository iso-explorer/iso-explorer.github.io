That is an allowable standard conversion. </p>\n<p>Now, how do we rank those conversions? Amusingly, the line from the standard matches <strong>exactly</strong> our use-case, in [over.ics.rank]:</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p id=\"so_32522701_32523222_1\">Two conversion sequences with the same rank\n  are indistinguishable unless one of the following rules applies:<br>\n  \u2014 If class B is derived directly or indirectly from class A and class C is derived directly or indirectly from\n  B,<br>\n  \u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u2014 <strong>conversion of C* to B* is better than conversion of C* to A*</strong></br></br></p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>We have two conversions sequences of the same rank (Conversion), that are both viable, but one is considered better than the other. The code should unambiguously prefer <code>foo(B* )</code> over <code>foo(A* )</code>. The fact that <code>c</code> is declared an array should not make it ambiguous. </p>\n", "LastActivityDate": "2015-09-11T12:10:28.967", "CommentCount": "0", "CreationDate": "2015-09-11T12:10:28.967", "ParentId": "32522701", "Score": "5", "OwnerUserId": "2069064"}, "bq_ids": {"n4140": {"so_32522701_32523222_0": {"length": 41, "quality": 1.0, "section_id": 0}, "so_32522701_32523222_1": {"length": 23, "quality": 1.0, "section_id": 640}}, "n3337": {"so_32522701_32523222_0": {"length": 41, "quality": 1.0, "section_id": 0}, "so_32522701_32523222_1": {"length": 23, "quality": 1.0, "section_id": 630}}, "n4659": {"so_32522701_32523222_0": {"length": 37, "quality": 0.9024390243902439, "section_id": 0}, "so_32522701_32523222_1": {"length": 23, "quality": 1.0, "section_id": 668}}}, "32522860": {"Id": "32522860", "PostTypeId": "2", "Body": "<p><code>C c[10]</code> is not a polymorphic type.
