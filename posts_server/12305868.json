One minor difference is that <code>wchar_t</code> is a typedef in C, and a built-in type (whose name is a keyword) in C++. But since C++ shares most of the C library, including functions that act on wide strings, it's safe to assume that the C and C++ definitions are compatible. (If someone can find something more concrete in the C++ standard, please comment or edit this paragraph.)</p>\n<p>In both C and C++, the size of a <code>wchar_t</code> is implementation-defined.  It's typically either 2 or 4 bytes (16 or 32 bits, unless you're on a very exotic system with bytes bigger than 8 bits). A wide string is a sequence of wide characters (<code>wchar_t</code> values), terminated by a null wide character.  The terminating wide character will have the same size as any other wide character, typically either 2 or 4 bytes.</p>\n<p>In particular, given that <code>wchar_t</code> is bigger than <code>char</code>, a <em>single</em> null byte does not terminate a wide string.</p>\n<p>It's also worth noting that byte order is implementation-defined. A wide character with the value <code>0x1234</code>, when viewed as a sequence of 8-bit bytes, might appear as any of:</p>\n<ul>\n<li><code>0x12</code>, <code>0x34</code></li>\n<li><code>0x34</code>, <code>0x12</code></li>\n<li><code>0x00</code>, <code>0x00</code>, <code>0x12</code>, <code>0x34</code></li>\n<li><code>0x34</code>, <code>0x12</code>, <code>0x00</code>, <code>0x00</code></li>\n</ul>\n<p>And those aren't the only possibilities.</p>\n", "LastActivityDate": "2012-09-06T19:36:03.340", "CommentCount": "0", "CreationDate": "2012-09-06T19:36:03.340", "ParentId": "12305868", "Score": "4", "OwnerUserId": "827263"}, "12305968": {"Id": "12305968", "PostTypeId": "2", "Body": "<p>Here you can read a bit more of Wide Characters: <a href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wide_character#Size_of_a_wide_character\" rel=\"nofollow\">http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wide_character#Size_of_a_wide_character</a></p>\n<p>Terminations are L'\\0', means a 16-bit null so it's like two 8-bit null chars.</p>\n<p>Remember that \"009A\" is only 1 wchar so is not a null wchar.</p>\n", "LastActivityDate": "2012-09-06T18:12:02.563", "CommentCount": "0", "CreationDate": "2012-09-06T18:12:02.563", "ParentId": "12305868", "Score": "4", "OwnerUserId": "1525495"}, "bq_ids": {"n4140": {"so_12305868_12307147_0": {"length": 7, "quality": 0.5833333333333334, "section_id": 5313}}, "n3337": {"so_12305868_12307147_0": {"length": 7, "quality": 0.5833333333333334, "section_id": 5110}}, "n4659": {"so_12305868_12307147_0": {"length": 7, "quality": 0.5833333333333334, "section_id": 6737}}}, "40388451": {"Id": "40388451", "PostTypeId": "2", "Body": "<p>if you declare </p>\n<pre><code>WCHAR tempWchar[BUFFER_SIZE];\n</code></pre>\n<p>you make it null</p>\n<pre><code>for (int i = 0; i &lt; BUFFER_SIZE; i++)\n            tempWchar[i] = NULL;\n</code></pre>\n", "LastActivityDate": "2016-11-02T19:43:00.030", "CommentCount": "0", "CreationDate": "2016-11-02T19:43:00.030", "ParentId": "12305868", "Score": "0", "OwnerUserId": "5548047"}, "12305868": {"ViewCount": "6511", "Body": "<p>I just don't understand and can't find much info about wchar end.</p>\n<p>If it ends with single null byte, how it know it not string end yet, if something like that \"009A\" represent one of unicode symbols?</p>\n<p>If it ends with two null bytes?
