For instance, defining a set of macros like this</p>\n<pre><code>#define WIDEN_(x) L##x\n#define WIDEN(x) WIDEN_(x)\n</code></pre>\n<p>and converting the offending line of code to</p>\n<pre><code>swscanf (line.c_str(), L\"Value of integer: %\" WIDEN(SCNd16) L\"\\n\", &amp;my_integer);\n</code></pre>\n<p>would fix the problem, but it doesn't on VS2013 because of an implementation detail.
