When you compile this, what is the compiler substituting for T when it instantiates instance?  It can't do all possible values of T, so it won't instantiate anything.  Some compilers will complain that instance is even there.  Providing an int makes it possible to actually instantiate something.</p>\n", "OwnerUserId": "3877819", "PostTypeId": "2", "Id": "24961033", "Score": "-1", "CreationDate": "2014-07-25T17:12:21.660", "LastActivityDate": "2014-07-25T17:12:21.660"}, "24961075": {"ParentId": "24960863", "PostTypeId": "2", "CommentCount": "0", "Body": "<p>14.7.1 Implicit instantiation <strong>[temp.inst]</strong>:</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p id=\"so_24960863_24961075_0\">2 - [...] [T]he initialization (and any associated side-effects) of a static data member does not occur unless the static data member is itself used in a way\n  that requires the definition of the static data member to exist.

This is a good thing, in part for efficiency and also because it means that e.g. member functions that are only valid for some instantiations can still be written in the general template; they will only be instantiated, possibly making the program ill-formed, if they are called.</p>\n", "OwnerUserId": "567292", "LastEditorUserId": "567292", "LastEditDate": "2014-07-25T17:22:34.103", "Id": "24961075", "Score": "5", "CreationDate": "2014-07-25T17:14:35.920", "LastActivityDate": "2014-07-25T17:22:34.103"}, "bq_ids": {"n4140": {"so_24960863_24961075_0": {"section_id": 234, "quality": 0.5757575757575758, "length": 19}}, "n3337": {"so_24960863_24961075_0": {"section_id": 227, "quality": 0.5757575757575758, "length": 19}}, "n4659": {"so_24960863_24961075_0": {"section_id": 244, "quality": 0.5454545454545454, "length": 18}}}, "24960863": {"CommentCount": "0", "ViewCount": "77", "PostTypeId": "1", "LastEditorUserId": "1321576", "CreationDate": "2014-07-25T17:03:19.217", "LastActivityDate": "2014-07-25T17:22:34.103", "Title": "Why isn't this static member of template class initialized?", "LastEditDate": "2014-07-25T17:11:46.373", "Id": "24960863", "Score": "1", "Body": "<pre><code>template &lt;typename T&gt;\nclass A\n{\n    public:\n    A() {p = this;}\n    static A *GetP() {return p;}\n\n    private:\n    static A *p;\n    static A instance;\n}\n\ntemplate &lt;typename T&gt;\nA&lt;T&gt; *A&lt;T&gt;::p = (A&lt;T&gt; *)4534;    //just test value to check whether p is initiallized or not.\n\ntemplate &lt;typename T&gt;\nA&lt;T&gt; A&lt;T&gt;::instance;\n</code></pre>\n<p>And I call <code>A&lt;int&gt;::GetP()</code>.
