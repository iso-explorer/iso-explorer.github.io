The null pointer value is converted to the null pointer value of the destination type. If the prvalue of type \"pointer to <em>cv1</em> <code>B</code>\" points\n  to a <code>B</code> that is actually a subobject of an object of type <code>D</code>, the resulting pointer points to the enclosing object\n  of type <code>D</code>.
