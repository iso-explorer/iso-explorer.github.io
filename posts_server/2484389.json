Having a reference to the container object in the contained object seems to be the best way to do this. Of course, I could do this with a pointer, that way I could have  a setter <code>setB(B* b) {mb = b;}</code> which I could call later after I am sure B is initialized but I would much prefer to do this with a reference which means I need to initialize it in the constructor, hence the problem. </p>\n", "Tags": "<c++><constructor>", "OwnerUserId": "66455", "AnswerCount": "3"}, "2484396": {"ParentId": "2484389", "CommentCount": "0", "Body": "<p>Since you're only initializing the reference to B, this should be just fine -- by the time B's constructor runs the memory location for it has already been setup.</p>\n<p>Do keep in mind that you can't call any methods in B safely from A's constructor because B has not finished constructing yet.</p>\n", "OwnerUserId": "82320", "PostTypeId": "2", "Id": "2484396", "Score": "9", "CreationDate": "2010-03-20T19:25:44.077", "LastActivityDate": "2010-03-20T19:25:44.077"}, "bq_ids": {"n4140": {"so_2484389_2484878_0": {"section_id": 7194, "quality": 0.75, "length": 45}}, "n3337": {"so_2484389_2484878_0": {"section_id": 6938, "quality": 0.7666666666666667, "length": 46}}, "n4659": {"so_2484389_2484878_0": {"section_id": 8703, "quality": 0.7166666666666667, "length": 43}}}, "2484878": {"ParentId": "2484389", "CommentCount": "1", "Body": "<p>The appropriate quote from the standard is:</p>\n<p>\u00a73.8 [basic.life]/6</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p id=\"so_2484389_2484878_0\">Similarly, before the lifetime of an object has started but after the storage which the object will occupy has been allocated or, after the lifetime of an object has ended and before the storage which the object occupied is reused or released, any lvalue which refers to the original object may be used but only in limited ways.
