Realistically the committee knew that whatever\nrules they formulated could not require a mandatory\ndiagnostic for every func(\"string\") in the existing world.</p>\n<p>So they decided to leave \"...\" of ordinary char array\ntype, but say one was required not to write over it.</p>\n<p>This note, BTW, isn't intended to be read as a snipe\nat the formulation in C89.
