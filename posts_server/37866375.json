However, even if you took away the <code>constexpr</code> part, it would <em>still</em> not be legal C++. Your code violates strict aliasing rules and therefore represents undefined behavior.</p>\n<p>Indeed, there is no way in C++ to detect the endian-ness of an object without invoking undefined behavior. Casting it to a <code>char*</code> doesn't work, because the standard doesn't require big or little endian order. So while you could read the data through a byte, you would not be able to legally infer anything from that value.</p>\n<p>And type punning through a <code>union</code> fails because you're not allowed to type pun through a <code>union</code> in C++ at all. And even if you did... again, C++ does not restrict implementations to big or little endian order.</p>\n<p>So as far as C++ as a standard is concerned, there is no way to detect this, whether at compile-time or runtime.</p>\n", "Score": "2", "LastActivityDate": "2016-06-16T18:31:17.477", "CreationDate": "2016-06-16T18:31:17.477", "ParentId": "37866375", "CommentCount": "10", "OwnerUserId": "734069"}, "37866503": {"Id": "37866503", "PostTypeId": "2", "LastEditDate": "2016-06-16T18:22:00.240", "CommentCount": "5", "LastEditorUserId": "2069064", "LastActivityDate": "2016-06-16T18:22:00.240", "CreationDate": "2016-06-16T18:12:59.863", "ParentId": "37866375", "Score": "9", "Body": "<p>None.
