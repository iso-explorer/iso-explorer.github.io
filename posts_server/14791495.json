It's about making sure every thread that successfully locks the spinlock \"sees\" the changes of every thread that locked it before.</p>\n<p>The modification order is the key to making the algorithm lockfree.  Both thread 1 and thread 2 are trying to do a test_and_set on the same variable, so by the rules, one modification \"happens before\" the other.  Because the test_and_set that \"happens before\" the other gets to \"progress,\" at least one thread must always make progress.
