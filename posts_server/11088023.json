One obvious example would be if you had deleted the move assignment operator, and were assigning the result (rather than using it to initialize). In this case, the deleted move assignment operator would prevent moving the return value.</p>\n<p>To answer what you may have been getting at, though, the general rule is that moving will be done if possible, and it'll fall back to copying if and only if something prevents the result from being moved.</p>\n", "OwnerUserId": "179910", "LastEditorUserId": "179910", "LastEditDate": "2012-06-18T17:53:22.830", "Id": "11088239", "Score": "2", "CreationDate": "2012-06-18T17:47:25.127", "LastActivityDate": "2012-06-18T17:53:22.830"}, "11088507": {"ParentId": "11088023", "CommentCount": "1", "Body": "<p>Yes.
