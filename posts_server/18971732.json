In this list, each type provides at least as much storage as those preceding it in the list.</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>There's also a table 9 in <code>7.1.6.2 Simple type specifiers</code>, which shows the \"mappings\" of the specifiers to actual types (showing that the <code>int</code> is optional), a section of which is shown below:</p>\n<pre><code>Specifier(s)         Type\n-------------    -------------\nlong long int    long long int\nlong long        long long int\nlong int         long int\nlong             long int\n</code></pre>\n<p>Note the distinction there between the specifier and the type.

Ditto for <code>long long</code> being a specifier for the <code>long long int</code> type.</p>\n<p>Although the C++ standard itself doesn't specify the minimum ranges of integral types, it does cite C99, in <code>1.2 Normative references</code>, as applying.
