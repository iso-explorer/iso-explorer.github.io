Premature internal-locking in the class implementation just in case someone was doing it multi-threaded (when there wasn't even a threading standard) was also not a good idea. In fact it was more costly to do anything of this than simply copy the buffer each time. Same reason \"copy on write\" implementation was abandoned for string implementations.</p>\n<p>Thus making <code>.c_str()</code> a truly immutable operation turned out to be the most sensible thing to do, however could one \"rely\" on it in a standard that now is thread-aware? Therefore the new standard decided to clearly state that you can, and thus the internal representation needs to hold the null terminator.</p>\n", "LastEditorUserId": "485561", "LastActivityDate": "2012-10-24T12:24:11.820", "Score": "9", "CreationDate": "2012-10-24T11:15:38.193", "ParentId": "7554039", "CommentCount": "1", "OwnerUserId": "442284", "LastEditDate": "2012-10-24T12:24:11.820"}, "7554039": {"ViewCount": "7678", "Body": "<p>In C++11 <code>basic_string::c_str</code> is defined to be exactly the same as <code>basic_string::data</code>, which is in turn defined to be exactly the same as <code>*(begin() + n)</code> and <code>*(&amp;*begin() + n)</code> (when <code>0 &lt;= n &lt; size()</code>).</p>\n<p>I cannot find anything that requires the string to always have a null character at its end.</p>\n<p>Does this mean that <code>c_str()</code> is no longer guaranteed to produce a null-terminated string?</p>\n", "AcceptedAnswerId": "7554172", "Title": "Is string::c_str() no longer null terminated in C++11?", "CreationDate": "2011-09-26T10:56:51.730", "Id": "7554039", "CommentCount": "4", "FavoriteCount": "9", "PostTypeId": "1", "LastEditDate": "2011-09-26T11:00:48.903", "LastEditorUserId": "476681", "LastActivityDate": "2013-02-01T17:00:16.623", "Score": "72", "OwnerUserId": "485561", "Tags": "<c++><string><c++11>", "AnswerCount": "4"}, "7554136": {"Id": "7554136", "PostTypeId": "2", "Body": "<p>Well, in fact it is true that the new standard stipulates that .data() and .c_str() are now synonyms.
