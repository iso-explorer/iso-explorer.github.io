This is not guaranteed by the C++ standard, but it's practically always the case.  A <code>char</code> is always <em>at least</em> 8 bits large, and the exact number of bits is given by the preprocessor constant <code>CHAR_BIT</code>.  Also, the <code>sizeof()</code> operator tells you the size of an object/type in terms of the number of <code>char</code>s, not the number of <s>bytes</s> octets, so if you were on some weird system with a 16-bit <code>char</code> and a 32-bit <code>int</code>, then <code>sizeof(int)</code> would be 2, not 4.</p>\n<p><strong>EDIT:</strong> Replaced byte by octet.  A <code>char</code> is guaranteed to be a byte by the C standard, but a byte is not guaranteed to be an octet, which is exactly 8 bits.  If you've ever read any French technical literature, they always use 'octet' instead of 'byte', and they have kilooctets (KO), megaoctets (MO), etc. instead of kilbytes and megabytes.</p>\n", "OwnerUserId": "9530", "LastEditorUserId": "9530", "LastEditDate": "2009-05-18T14:49:15.520", "Id": "876223", "Score": "1", "CreationDate": "2009-05-18T04:10:22.073", "LastActivityDate": "2009-05-18T14:49:15.520"}, "876263": {"ParentId": "876213", "CommentCount": "1", "Body": "<p>There is no byte type in C++.
