For instance, pointers for <code>shorts</code> would be on multiples of 2 bytes, <code>char</code> pointers are unrestricted, etc. Not all systems have this requirement, but accesses on unaligned memory on these systems are frequently very slow, and so typically programmers try to keep everything aligned anyways.</p>\n<p>You can find the alignment requirement for a type with <code>alignof</code>, if you want to poke around on your system. A pointer that isn't aligned properly for any type might be something like <code>0xFFFF0002</code>, which wouldn't be aligned for any 4 byte or higher type.</p>\n<p>In short, what that documentation is saying is that the memory returned will be aligned for any fundemental type.</p>\n", "LastEditorUserId": "2252889", "LastActivityDate": "2014-07-17T18:48:58.460", "Score": "2", "CreationDate": "2014-07-17T18:40:40.293", "ParentId": "24811030", "CommentCount": "0", "OwnerUserId": "2252889", "LastEditDate": "2014-07-17T18:48:58.460"}, "24811030": {"ViewCount": "149", "Body": "<p>[basic.stc.dynamic.allocation]/2 about allocation functions:</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p id=\"so_24811030_24811030_0\">The pointer returned <strong>shall be suitably aligned</strong> so that it can be\n  converted to a pointer of any complete object type with a fundamental\n  alignment requirement (3.11) and then used to access the object or\n  array in the storage allocated (until the storage is explicitly\n  deallocated by a call to a corresponding deallocation function).</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>It is a bit inclear.
