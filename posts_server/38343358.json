But what is wrong with the next two lines? I think this may have something to do with the difference between native types and class types, but I am not sure.</p>\n<p>This is not a duplicate question of <a href=\"https://stackoverflow.com/questions/92396/why-cant-variables-be-declared-in-a-switch-statement\">Why can't variables be declared in a switch statement?</a>!
