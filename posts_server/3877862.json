So it's a good habit to initialise all variables -- it can't hurt but can help.</p>\n", "LastActivityDate": "2010-10-07T00:48:35.153", "LastEditorUserId": "47984", "Id": "3877884", "CommentCount": "11", "CreationDate": "2010-10-07T00:28:04.407", "ParentId": "3877862", "Score": "17", "OwnerUserId": "47984", "LastEditDate": "2010-10-07T00:48:35.153"}});
