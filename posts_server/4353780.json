As you noticed, fractional literals are double unless explicitly made floats. Also, floats can't be passed in varargs, they're always promoted to double (in the same way char and short are promoted to int in varargs).</p>\n<p>It's probably better to think of <code>float</code> as being a contracted <code>double</code>, rather than <code>double</code> being an extended <code>float</code>. That is, <code>double</code> is the preferred floating point type, and <code>float</code> is used whenever a smaller version of <code>double</code> is required for some particular case. That's the closest I know to a coherent reason, and then the rule makes sense, even if you happen to be in the case where you need a smaller version.</p>\n", "LastEditorUserId": "13005", "LastActivityDate": "2010-12-04T17:18:52.390", "Score": "4", "CreationDate": "2010-12-04T14:17:21.713", "ParentId": "4353780", "CommentCount": "0", "OwnerUserId": "13005", "LastEditDate": "2010-12-04T17:18:52.390"}, "4353780": {"ViewCount": "4167", "Body": "<p>Why do I need to put 3.14f instead of 3.14 to disable all those warnings ?\nIs there a coherent reason reason for this ?</p>\n", "AcceptedAnswerId": "4353788", "Title": "Why floating point value such as 3.14 are considered as double by default in MSVC?", "CreationDate": "2010-12-04T13:42:32.070", "Id": "4353780", "CommentCount": "0", "FavoriteCount": "1", "PostTypeId": "1", "LastEditDate": "2012-06-20T20:40:03.553", "LastEditorUserId": "44390", "LastActivityDate": "2012-06-20T20:40:03.553", "Score": "8", "OwnerUserId": "414063", "Tags": "<c++><visual-c++><floating-point><double>", "AnswerCount": "5"}, "bq_ids": {"n4140": {"so_4353780_4353788_0": {"length": 22, "quality": 0.8148148148148148, "section_id": 5348}}, "n3337": {"so_4353780_4353788_0": {"length": 21, "quality": 0.7777777777777778, "section_id": 5145}}, "n4659": {"so_4353780_4353788_0": {"length": 22, "quality": 0.8148148148148148, "section_id": 6773}}}, "4353788": {"Id": "4353788", "PostTypeId": "2", "Body": "<p>That's what the C++ (and C) standard decided.
