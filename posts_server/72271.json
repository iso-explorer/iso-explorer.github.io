According to the ANSI standard the <code>#include</code> of a file at the beginning inserts the file exactly as it is to the front of the file and does not insert the new line after the <code>#include &lt;foo.h&gt;</code> after the contents of the file. So if you include a file with no newline at the end to the parser it will be viewed as if the last line of <code>foo.h</code> is on the same line as the first line of <code>foo.cpp</code>. What if the last line of foo.h was a comment without a new line? Now the first line of <code>foo.cpp</code> is commented out. These are just a couple of examples of the types of problems that can creep up.</p>\n<p><strong>Edit</strong>: Just wanted to point any interested parties to James' answer below.
