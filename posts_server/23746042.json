If you push_back enough items to exceed the size of the memory buffer that's the backing store of the vector, a new buffer will be created, all the contents will be copied to the new location, and the old buffer will be deleted.  At that point, old pointers (as well as iterators!) will be invalid.</p>\n<p>If you know exactly how much maximum space you will ever need, you could set the size of the vector's buffer to that size when you create it, to avoid reallocation.  However, I prefer to store \"references\" to elements of a vector as a reference to the vector and a size_t index into the vector, instead of using pointers.  It's not necessarily slower than pointers (depending on the CPU type) but, even if it is, it won't be much slower and in my opinion it's worth it for the peace of mind knowing that no matter how the vector is used in the future or reallocated, it'll still refer to the proper element.</p>\n", "LastActivityDate": "2014-05-19T19:57:21.863"}, "bq_ids": {"n4140": {"so_23746042_23746114_0": {"section_id": 986, "quality": 0.9473684210526315, "length": 18}}, "n3337": {"so_23746042_23746114_0": {"section_id": 971, "quality": 0.9473684210526315, "length": 18}}, "n4659": {"so_23746042_23746114_0": {"section_id": 1049, "quality": 0.9473684210526315, "length": 18}}}});
