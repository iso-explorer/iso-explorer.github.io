post_cb({"1089220": {"Id": "1089220", "PostTypeId": "2", "Body": "<p>According to the standard it is unsigned, however I recall that some older implementations used a signed type for the typedef.  </p>\n<p>From an older GCC doc:</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p id=\"so_1089176_1089220_0\">There is a potential problem with the size_t type and versions of GCC prior to release 2.4. ANSI C requires that <code>size_t</code> always be an unsigned type. For compatibility with existing systems' header files, GCC defines <code>size_t</code> in <code>stddef.h</code> to be whatever type the system's <code>sys/types.h</code> defines it to be. Most Unix systems that define <code>size_t</code> in <code>sys/types.h</code>, define it to be a signed type. Some code in the library depends on <code>size_t</code> being an unsigned type, and will not work correctly if it is signed</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>I'm not sure how important it would be to guard against that.  My code assumes it's unsigned.</p>\n", "LastActivityDate": "2009-07-06T21:06:18.937", "CommentCount": "2", "CreationDate": "2009-07-06T21:06:18.937", "ParentId": "1089176", "Score": "5", "OwnerUserId": "12711"}, "bq_ids": {"n4140": {"so_1089176_1089204_0": {"length": 5, "quality": 0.7142857142857143, "section_id": 6704}}, "n3337": {"so_1089176_1089204_0": {"length": 5, "quality": 0.7142857142857143, "section_id": 6459}}, "n4659": {"so_1089176_1089204_0": {"length": 5, "quality": 0.7142857142857143, "section_id": 8177}}}, "40930436": {"Id": "40930436", "PostTypeId": "2", "Body": "<p>Oh, this is just terrible:</p>\n<pre><code>vector&lt;MyObject&gt; arr;\nFill(arr);\nsize_t size = arr.size();\nfor(size_t i = 1; i &lt; size - 1; ++i)\n{\n  auto obj = arr[i];\n  auto next = arr[i+1];\n}\n</code></pre>\n<p>Now contemplate the use case where arr is empty.</p>\n", "LastActivityDate": "2016-12-02T10:49:42.737", "CommentCount": "0", "CreationDate": "2016-12-02T10:49:42.737", "ParentId": "1089176", "Score": "1", "OwnerUserId": "711202"}, "1089181": {"Id": "1089181", "PostTypeId": "2", "Body": "<p><strong>Yes</strong>.
