Essentially it boils down to the question whether the value is negative or too big. If so, it is an error.</p>\n<p>A <em>core constant expression</em> is something the compiler can and will compute at compile time. If the corresponding expression can, thus, statically be determined to be erroneous, it is a compile-time error. If the the expression is not a constant, it may not be possible to determine its value during compile time. However, in that case an error would be detected at run-time and the error has to result in an exception.</p>\n", "LastActivityDate": "2015-12-10T18:56:52.810"}, "34209484": {"CommentCount": "1", "ViewCount": "84", "PostTypeId": "1", "LastEditorUserId": "411165", "CreationDate": "2015-12-10T18:49:41.197", "LastActivityDate": "2015-12-10T19:00:48.077", "Title": "Erroneous expression in a nonptr-new-declarator", "AcceptedAnswerId": "34209591", "LastEditDate": "2015-12-10T19:00:48.077", "Id": "34209484", "Score": "2", "Body": "<p>In [expr.new]/7 there is the following phrase:  </p>\n<blockquote>\n<p id=\"so_34209484_34209484_0\">If the <em>expression</em>, after converting to <code>std::size_t</code>, is a core\n  constant expression and the expression is erroneous, the program is\n  ill-formed.
