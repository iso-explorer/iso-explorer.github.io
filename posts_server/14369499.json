They also consume some extra memory to keep the linking\n  information associated to each element (which may be an important\n  factor for large lists of small-sized elements).</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>So, iterating through a std::list&lt; &gt; (looking up an element) is linear complexity.  Also, you cannot access elements by index.</p>\n", "LastActivityDate": "2013-01-16T23:25:37.053", "CommentCount": "0", "CreationDate": "2013-01-16T23:25:37.053", "ParentId": "14369499", "Score": "1", "OwnerUserId": "1742632"}, "14369748": {"Id": "14369748", "PostTypeId": "2", "Body": "<p>You mention that you had no trouble except with the <code>list</code> portion, so I'm only going to answer for that portion.</p>\n<p>In order to answer this question, you need to understand how <a href=\"http://en.cppreference.com/w/cpp/container/list\" rel=\"nofollow\"><code>std::list</code></a> is implemented.\nSome quick searching brings up:</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p id=\"so_14369499_14369748_0\">List containers are implemented as doubly-linked lists. </p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>From how I interpret it, <strong>Guaranteed Performance</strong> means the same thing as <strong>Worse-case Runtime Complexity</strong>.</p>\n<p>For <strong>element lookup</strong> in a doubly-linked list, the worst-case scenario is that your list does not contain the item you are trying to lookup. In that case, you would have to compare every item in the list to the item you are searching for. So the worst-case runtime complexity of this operation is <strong>O(n)</strong>, where <code>n</code> is the size of the list.</p>\n", "LastEditorDisplayName": "user283145", "LastActivityDate": "2013-01-20T18:54:38.890", "Score": "2", "CreationDate": "2013-01-16T23:25:26.467", "ParentId": "14369499", "CommentCount": "0", "OwnerUserId": "1825250", "LastEditDate": "2013-01-20T18:54:38.890"}, "bq_ids": {"n4140": {"so_14369499_14370750_3": {"length": 6, "quality": 0.8571428571428571, "section_id": 1258}, "so_14369499_14370750_1": {"length": 6, "quality": 1.0, "section_id": 902}, "so_14369499_14370750_2": {"length": 10, "quality": 1.0, "section_id": 5593}}, "n3337": {"so_14369499_14370750_3": {"length": 6, "quality": 0.8571428571428571, "section_id": 1256}, "so_14369499_14370750_1": {"length": 6, "quality": 1.0, "section_id": 888}, "so_14369499_14370750_2": {"length": 10, "quality": 1.0, "section_id": 5376}, "so_14369499_14370750_0": {"length": 4, "quality": 0.8, "section_id": 1427}}, "n4659": {"so_14369499_14370750_3": {"length": 6, "quality": 0.8571428571428571, "section_id": 1378}, "so_14369499_14370750_1": {"length": 6, "quality": 1.0, "section_id": 962}, "so_14369499_14370750_2": {"length": 10, "quality": 1.0, "section_id": 7037}}}, "14370750": {"Id": "14370750", "PostTypeId": "2", "Body": "<p>In case you want a more formal statement of what's supported, here's what the standard has to say.
