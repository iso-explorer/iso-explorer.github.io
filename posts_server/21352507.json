But you can easily reason it as follows:</p>\n<p>The inheritance relation is often termed with \"is\". For example, an object of type <code>B</code> is also of type <code>A</code>. In other words <code>B</code> is a kind of <code>A</code>. The constructor of <code>A</code> constructs an object of type <code>A</code>. But <code>b</code> above is also a kind of <code>A</code>, so <code>A</code> must have a constructor to be able to construct it.</p>\n", "OwnerUserId": "912144", "PostTypeId": "2", "Id": "21352602", "Score": "4", "CreationDate": "2014-01-25T15:42:39.580", "LastActivityDate": "2014-01-25T15:42:39.580"}, "21352618": {"ParentId": "21352507", "CommentCount": "0", "Body": "<p>Abstract classes can contain member variables and to initialize those member variables Abstract classes need constructor. </p>\n", "OwnerUserId": "2573687", "PostTypeId": "2", "Id": "21352618", "Score": "1", "CreationDate": "2014-01-25T15:44:19.733", "LastActivityDate": "2014-01-25T15:44:19.733"}, "21352605": {"ParentId": "21352507", "CommentCount": "1", "Body": "<blockquote>\n<p id=\"so_21352507_21352605_0\">Does \u201cConstructor of an abstract class\u201d exists?</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>Let's say that there can be an abstract class constructor. Just like any other class. By default (if you don't declare a \"custom\" constructor or you don't have member objects that have no default constructor) there are two implicitly defined: the <em>default constructor</em> and the <em>copy constructor</em>.</p>\n<p>So in a declaration like this:</p>\n<pre><code>struct abstract_class {\n    virtual void func() = 0;\n}\n</code></pre>\n<p>you still have constructors.</p>\n<hr>\n<blockquote>\n<p id=\"so_21352507_21352605_1\">We can not create an object of abstract class.</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>Yes. For the most common definition of <em>abstract class</em>, that is true. If a class does have <em>pure virtual</em> functions, it is considered to be an <em>abstract class</em> and of course it cannot be instantiated.</p>\n<hr>\n<blockquote>\n<p id=\"so_21352507_21352605_2\">And constructors create new instances of any class which is called as an object.</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>I'd rephrase that to: You construct objects of a class type via their constructor. And yes, in C++, an <em>object</em> is (from \u00a71.8/1):</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p id=\"so_21352507_21352605_3\">An object is a region of storage.</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>And that's that. For example:</p>\n<pre><code>int x = 0;\n</code></pre>\n<p>is an object too. An <em>object</em> does not necessarily mean a class type.</p>\n</hr></hr>", "OwnerUserId": "493122", "PostTypeId": "2", "Id": "21352605", "Score": "2", "CreationDate": "2014-01-25T15:43:02.377", "LastActivityDate": "2014-01-25T15:43:02.377"}, "bq_ids": {"n4140": {"so_21352507_21352605_1": {"section_id": 300, "quality": 0.8, "length": 4}, "so_21352507_21352605_2": {"section_id": 371, "quality": 0.625, "length": 5}}, "n3337": {"so_21352507_21352605_1": {"section_id": 291, "quality": 0.8, "length": 4}, "so_21352507_21352605_2": {"section_id": 361, "quality": 0.625, "length": 5}}, "n4659": {"so_21352507_21352605_1": {"section_id": 307, "quality": 0.8, "length": 4}, "so_21352507_21352605_2": {"section_id": 385, "quality": 0.625, "length": 5}}}});
