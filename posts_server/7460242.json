C++ already provides a templated generic link list <strong><a href=\"http://www.cplusplus.com/reference/stl/list/\" rel=\"nofollow\">std::list</a></strong> for this purpose, You can use it as there is no point in re-inventing the wheel and it is most likely that the standard link list implementation will be better than any custom implemented version of a generic link list. </br></p>\n<p>If you would still want to have your own version of the link list. You should implement a generic template link list class just what <strong>std::list</strong> does.  </p>\n<p>Have a look at <strong><a href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Template_%28programming%29\" rel=\"nofollow\">Template Programming</a></strong>.</p>\n<hr>\n<p><strong>Reference:</strong><br>\nAs per <strong>C++03 Standard section 5.3.5/3:</strong> </br></p>\n<blockquote>\n<p id=\"so_7460242_7460258_0\">In the first alternative (delete object), if the static type of the operand is different from its dynamic type, the static type shall be a base class of the operand\u2019s dynamic type and the static type shall have a virtual destructor or the behavior is undefined.
