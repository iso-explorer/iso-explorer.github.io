In such a case, passing by value may no require actually passing anything at all -- the \"value\" that's passed is basically little or nothing more than a placeholder for \"this is the object\".</p>\n<p>Given the small amount of code in many function objects, that leads to a further optimization: it's often fairly easy for the compiler to expand the code for the function object inline, so no parameters get passed, and no function call is involved at all.</p>\n<p>A compiler <em>may</em> be able to do the same when you pass a pointer or reference instead, but it's not quite as easy -- a lot more common that you'll end up with an object being created, its address passed, and then the function call operator for that object being invoked via that pointer.</p>\n<p>Edit: It's probably also worth mentioning that the same applies to lambdas, since they're really just function objects in disguise. You don't know the name of the class, but they create a class in the immediately surrounding scope that overloads the function call operator, which is what gets invoked when you \"call\" the lambda.
