It is guaranteed that <code>char</code> is at least 8-bits.</p>\n<p>Finally, this is the definition of <em>byte</em> given by the C++ Standard (\u00a71.7, <strong>intro.memory</strong>) :</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p id=\"so_33570247_33570352_1\">The fundamental storage unit in the C++ memory model is the <em>byte</em>. A byte is at least large enough to contain\n  any member of the basic execution character set (2.3) and the eight-bit code units of the Unicode UTF-8\n  encoding form and is composed of a contiguous sequence of bits, the number of which is implementationdefined.\n  The least significant bit is called the <em>low-order bit</em>; the most significant bit is called the <em>high-order\n  bit</em>. The memory available to a C++ program consists of one or more sequences of contiguous bytes. Every\n  byte has a unique address.</p>\n</blockquote>\n", "LastActivityDate": "2015-11-06T22:49:25.337"}, "bq_ids": {"n4140": {"so_33570247_33570352_1": {"section_id": 5785, "quality": 0.875, "length": 49}}, "n3337": {"so_33570247_33570352_1": {"section_id": 5558, "quality": 0.875, "length": 49}}, "n4659": {"so_33570247_33570352_1": {"section_id": 7242, "quality": 0.875, "length": 49}}}, "33570506": {"ParentId": "33570247", "CommentCount": "6", "CreationDate": "2015-11-06T15:46:39.270", "OwnerUserId": "560648", "PostTypeId": "2", "Id": "33570506", "Score": "6", "Body": "<blockquote>\n<p id=\"so_33570247_33570506_0\">A byte means a 8-bit unit of memory.</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>That is incorrect.</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p id=\"so_33570247_33570506_1\">However, C++ defines byte differently.</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>That is also incorrect.</p>\n<p>In both C++ terminology and general parlance, a byte is the minimum unit of memory.
