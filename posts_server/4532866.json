Where did you get that strange idea? Pointer <code>this</code> has scalar type and is not an lvalue, meaning that it can't possibly be \"const\" or \"non-const\". Pointer <code>this</code> is an rvalue and it is non-modifiable.</p>\n<p>Secondly, the code in your question is valid regardless of whether the pointer involved is const or not. For example, the following code is valid for exactly the same reason</p>\n<pre><code>int *const p = 0; /* a const pointer */\n\nint *foo() { \n  return p; /* OK, no error here */\n}\n</code></pre>\n<p>What is returned in this case is a completely independent <em>copy</em> of the original pointer value. It does not matter whether <code>p</code> is const or not - making a copy of const value does not in any way violate its constness. </p>\n<p>This is exactly what's done in your code sample - you are returning a copy of <code>this</code>'s value.
