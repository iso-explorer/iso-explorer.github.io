Second, storage duration also applies to values of expressions, and of course the value of an expression is never a reference (but always an object).</p>\n<p>Finally, a non-static reference data member is stored as part of the object which contains it. So you can perfectly well have <code>struct T { int &amp; r; };</code> and have temporaries and dynamically allo\u00adcat\u00aded instances of type <code>T</code>. (Note also that you are not allowed to apply <code>offsetof</code> to <code>T</code>, since <code>T</code> is not standard-layout.)</p>\n", "OwnerUserId": "596781", "LastEditorUserId": "596781", "LastEditDate": "2016-06-05T09:44:21.313", "Id": "37640407", "Score": "4", "CreationDate": "2016-06-05T09:33:10.700", "LastActivityDate": "2016-06-05T09:44:21.313"}, "bq_ids": {"n4140": {"so_37640379_37640407_0": {"section_id": 3221, "quality": 1.0, "length": 5}, "so_37640379_37640407_1": {"section_id": 7163, "quality": 0.8571428571428571, "length": 6}}, "n3337": {"so_37640379_37640407_0": {"section_id": 3095, "quality": 1.0, "length": 5}, "so_37640379_37640407_1": {"section_id": 6907, "quality": 0.8571428571428571, "length": 6}}, "n4659": {"so_37640379_37640407_0": {"section_id": 3978, "quality": 1.0, "length": 5}, "so_37640379_37640407_1": {"section_id": 8670, "quality": 0.8571428571428571, "length": 6}}}});
