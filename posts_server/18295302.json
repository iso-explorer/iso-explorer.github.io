That includes objects of type <code>std::array&lt;T, N&gt;</code> and <code>T[N]</code>.</p>\n<p>Be aware that there are types for which default initialization has no effect and leaves the object's value indeterminate: any non-class, non-array type (\u00a78.5/6). Consequently, a default-initialized array of objects with such types will have indeterminate value, e.g.:</p>\n<pre><code>int plain_int;\nint c_style_array[13];\nstd::array&lt;int, 13&gt; cxx_style_array;\n</code></pre>\n<p>Both the c-style array and <code>std::array</code> are filled with integers of indeterminate value, just as <code>plain_int</code> has indeterminate value.</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p id=\"so_18295302_18295840_0\">Is there a syntax that will work on all arrays (including zero-sized arrays) to initialize all elements to their default value?</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>I'm guessing that when you say \"to their default value\" you really mean \"initialize all elements to <code>T{}</code>\". That's not <em>default-initialization</em>, it is <em>value-initialization</em> (8.5/7). You can request value initialization quite easily in C++11 by giving each declaration an empty initializer:</p>\n<pre><code>int plain_int{};\nint c_style_array[13]{};\nstd::array&lt;int, 13&gt; cxx_style_array{};\n</code></pre>\n<p>Which will value-initialize all of the array elements in turn, resulting in <code>plain_old_int</code>, and all the members of both kinds of arrays, being initialized to zero.</p>\n", "LastEditorUserId": "923854", "LastActivityDate": "2013-08-18T05:24:09.713", "Score": "81", "CreationDate": "2013-08-18T04:59:17.307", "ParentId": "18295302", "CommentCount": "5", "OwnerUserId": "923854", "LastEditDate": "2013-08-18T05:24:09.713"}, "18304935": {"Id": "18304935", "PostTypeId": "2", "Body": "<p><em>Default-initialization</em> is a term from the Standard potentially meaning no initialization at all, so you probably mean <em>zero-initialization</em>.</p>\n<p>The description at cppreference.com is actually a bit misleading. <code>std::array</code> is an aggregate class, and if the element type is primitive, it is POD: \"plain old data,\" with semantics closely matching the C language.

It has an implicitly-defined default constructor, but it is trivial, so it is never default-initialized.

This works since C++98. Note that C-style arrays cannot have zero extent, and that <code>sizeof (std::array&lt; X, 0 &gt;)</code> is not zero.</p>\n", "LastActivityDate": "2013-08-19T00:18:54.717", "CommentCount": "0", "CreationDate": "2013-08-19T00:18:54.717", "ParentId": "18295302", "Score": "10", "OwnerUserId": "153285"}, "bq_ids": {"n4140": {"so_18295302_18304935_1": {"length": 16, "quality": 1.0, "section_id": 3287}, "so_18295302_18304935_0": {"length": 4, "quality": 1.0, "section_id": 3287}}, "n3337": {"so_18295302_18304935_1": {"length": 10, "quality": 0.625, "section_id": 3157}, "so_18295302_18304935_0": {"length": 4, "quality": 1.0, "section_id": 3157}}, "n4659": {"so_18295302_18304935_1": {"length": 16, "quality": 1.0, "section_id": 4049}}}, "18295302": {"ViewCount": "33039", "Body": "<p>With C++11 <code>std::array</code>, do I have the guarantee that the syntax <code>std::array&lt;T, N&gt; x;</code> will default-initialize all the elements of the array ?</p>\n<p><strong>EDIT</strong>: if not, is there a syntax that will work on all arrays (including zero-sized arrays) to initialize all elements to their default value?</p>\n<p><strong>EDIT</strong>: on <a href=\"http://en.cppreference.com/w/cpp/container/array\" rel=\"noreferrer\">cppreference</a>, the default constructor description says:</p>\n<pre><code>(constructor) (implicitly declared) (public member function)\ndefault-constructs or copy-constructs every element of the array \n</code></pre>\n<p>so the answer may be yes.
