The only thing the footnote says is that member function defined in in-class fashion can \"see\" the whole class (as would be the case if it was defined in out-of-class fashion). It applies equally to all bullet points.</p>\n<p>For example, footnote 32 reaffirms that this code is valid</p>\n<pre><code>struct S\n{\n  void foo() { i = 42; }\n  int i;\n};\n</code></pre>\n<p>I.e. that the definition of <code>S::foo()</code> can \"see\" the declaration of <code>S::i</code> even though <code>S::i</code> is declared <em>below</em> the definition of <code>S::foo()</code>. As you can immediately see, the above example has no nested classes and thus has nothing to do with bullet point 3.</p>\n", "LastEditorUserId": "187690", "LastActivityDate": "2015-07-13T21:10:54.697", "Score": "1", "CreationDate": "2015-07-13T20:53:09.900", "ParentId": "31393043", "CommentCount": "0", "OwnerUserId": "187690", "LastEditDate": "2015-07-13T21:10:54.697"}, "bq_ids": {"n4140": {"so_31393043_31393043_1": {"length": 17, "quality": 0.9444444444444444, "section_id": 7094}, "so_31393043_31393043_0": {"length": 25, "quality": 0.9615384615384616, "section_id": 7094}}, "n3337": {"so_31393043_31393043_1": {"length": 17, "quality": 0.9444444444444444, "section_id": 6838}, "so_31393043_31393043_0": {"length": 14, "quality": 0.5384615384615384, "section_id": 6838}}, "n4659": {"so_31393043_31393043_1": {"length": 17, "quality": 0.9444444444444444, "section_id": 8595}, "so_31393043_31393043_0": {"length": 24, "quality": 0.9230769230769231, "section_id": 8595}}}, "31393043": {"ViewCount": "69", "Body": "<p>[basic.lookup.unqual]/8</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p id=\"so_31393043_31393043_0\">For the members of a class <code>X</code>, a name used in a member function body,\n  in a default argument, in an <em>exceptions-pecification</em>, in the\n  <em>brace-or-equal-initializer</em> of a non-static data member (9.2), or in the definition of a class member outside of the definition of <code>X</code>,\n  following the member\u2019s <em>declarator-id</em> <sup>31</sup>, shall be\n  declared in one of the following ways:</p>\n<ol>\n<li>before its use in the block in which it is used or in an enclosing block (6.3), or</li>\n<li>shall be a member of class <code>X</code> or be a member of a base class of <code>X</code> (10.2), or</li>\n<li>if <code>X</code> is a nested class of class <code>Y</code> (9.7), shall be a member of <code>Y</code>, or shall be a member of a base class of <code>Y</code> (this lookup applies\n  in turn to <code>Y</code>\u2019s enclosing classes, starting with the innermost\n  enclosing class),<sup><strong>32</strong></sup> or</li>\n<li>...</li>\n</ol>\n</blockquote>\n<p>Footnote:   </p>\n<blockquote>\n<p id=\"so_31393043_31393043_1\"><sub>32) This lookup applies whether the member function is defined within\n  the definition of class <code>X</code> or whether the member function is defined\n  in a namespace scope enclosing <code>X</code>\u2019s definition.</sub></p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>Am I right?</p>\n", "AcceptedAnswerId": "31393261", "Title": "I have the impression that footnote 32 below applies to the entire paragraph \u00a73.4.1/8 and not only to its third bullet point", "CreationDate": "2015-07-13T20:41:01.990", "Id": "31393043", "CommentCount": "3", "LastEditDate": "2015-07-13T20:42:58.677", "PostTypeId": "1", "LastEditorUserId": "1042389", "LastActivityDate": "2015-07-13T21:10:54.697", "Score": "1", "OwnerUserId": "1042389", "Tags": "<c++><language-lawyer><c++14>", "AnswerCount": "2"}, "31393387": {"Id": "31393387", "PostTypeId": "2", "Body": "<p>The footnote does not mean \"this statement is only true for bullet point 3\".</p>\n<p>It means \"by the way, this statement is [also] true for bullet point 3, a slightly more complex scenario with which you may have had your doubts as to the fact so stated\".</p>\n<p>So, while you're not objectively wrong, this is not any sort of editorial problem either.</p>\n", "LastActivityDate": "2015-07-13T21:00:23.740", "CommentCount": "0", "CreationDate": "2015-07-13T21:00:23.740", "ParentId": "31393043", "Score": "0", "OwnerUserId": "560648"}});
