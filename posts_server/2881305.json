Ok code:</p>\n<pre><code>class LINT_rep\n{\nprivate:\n    char* my_data_; //stores separately every single digit from a number\npublic:\n    class Iterator:public iterator&lt;bidirectional_operator_tag,char&gt;\n        {\nprivate: \nchar* myData_\npublic:\n        Iterator(const LINT_rep&amp;);\n    };\n};\n\n#include \"StdAfx.h\"\n#include \"LINT_rep.h\"\n\n\nLINT_rep::Iterator::Iterator(const LINT_rep&amp; owner):myData_(nullptr)\n{\n    myData_ = owner.my_data_; /*\n        HERE I'M ACCESSING my_data WHICH IS PRIVATE AND THIS   \n        CODE COMPILES ON VS2010 ULTIMATE BUT IT SHOULDN'T  \n        BECAUSE my_data IS PRIVATE AND OTHER CLASS SHOULDN'T  \n        HAVE ACCESS TO IT'S PRIVATE MEMB.
