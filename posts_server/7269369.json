Rather if A is smaller than a boundary then yes it will be bigger. EX a struct of RGB is the same size as a struct of RGBA.</p>\n<p>I don't have sample code that will do that. You have to dump memory and see the holes. If you then assume that everything is size aligned and cast a structure onto a wad of memory you will have bad data. This is why WADs had padding for alignment. As your compositions get more complicated, the ability to close holes by the compiler is diminished. Eventually padding will be introduced and any assumptions of memory layout will become more and more wrong.</p>\n", "LastEditorUserId": "664328", "LastActivityDate": "2011-09-01T11:47:51.450", "Score": "0", "CreationDate": "2011-09-01T11:06:24.620", "ParentId": "7269369", "CommentCount": "2", "OwnerUserId": "664328", "LastEditDate": "2011-09-01T11:47:51.450"}, "7269516": {"Id": "7269516", "PostTypeId": "2", "Body": "<p>While the struct can be padded, on all systems I know, the compiler will pad so that the alignment of the structure is the same as the largest alignment of its members.

What you want is the C ABI (application binary interface) for the system you're running on, which should specify default layout for structs (compilers can choose to override this if they see fit, see also #pragma pack).  For an example, look at the <a href=\"http://x86-64.org/documentation/abi.pdf\" rel=\"nofollow\">X86_64 ABI</a> page 13, which states:</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p id=\"so_7269369_7269516_0\">Aggregates and Unions Structures and unions assume the alignment of\n  their most strictly aligned compo- nent. Each member is assigned to\n  the lowest available offset with the appropriate alignment. The size\n  of any object is always a multiple of the object\u2018s alignment. An array\n  uses the same alignment as its elements, except that a local or global\n  array variable of length at least 16 bytes or a C99 variable-length\n  array variable always has alignment of at least 16 bytes. Structure\n  and union objects can require padding to meet size and alignment\n  constraints. The contents of any padding is unde\ufb01ned.</p>\n</blockquote>\n", "LastEditorUserId": "862231", "LastActivityDate": "2011-09-01T11:27:00.100", "Score": "3", "CreationDate": "2011-09-01T11:15:33.880", "ParentId": "7269369", "CommentCount": "4", "OwnerUserId": "862231", "LastEditDate": "2011-09-01T11:27:00.100"}, "7269459": {"Id": "7269459", "PostTypeId": "2", "Body": "<p>A struct <em>can</em> be padded (it's allowed for compilers do whatever they like, for example padding a six-octet type to eight to align with page boundaries).
