The <code>-&gt;</code> operator for <code>std::shared_ptr</code>, only returns a pointer to the member (lets say it is a instance of a class), yet at the same time it can be used to call methods... HOW? We are not doing anything to the pointer returned by the <code>-&gt;</code> operator, how do we call methods, and access instance variables?
