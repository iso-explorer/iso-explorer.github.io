That is, the compiler has to opt for the strictest alignment. But I can't find this in the Standard.</p>\n<p>The presenter also says that this rule doesn't apply when <code>new</code> is used to allocate <code>char</code> or <code>unsigned char</code> arrays. In this case, the alignment depends on the size. But this was not clear to me either.</p>\n", "Tags": "<c++><language-lawyer><c++14><memory-alignment>", "OwnerUserId": "1042389", "AnswerCount": "1"}});
