Thread IDs can be reused.</p>\n<hr>\n<p>The standard says</p>\n<blockquote>\n<ol>\n<li><p id=\"so_40418833_40418962_0\">An object of type thread::id provides a unique identifier for each\n  thread of execution and a single distinct value for all thread objects\n  that do not represent a thread of execution (30.3.1). Each thread of\n  execution has an associated thread::id object that is not equal to the\n  thread::id object of any other thread of execution and that is not\n  equal to the thread::id object of any std::thread object that does not\n  represent threads of execution.</p></li>\n<li><p id=\"so_40418833_40418962_1\">thread::id shall be a trivially\n  copyable class (Clause 9). The library may reuse the value of a\n  thread::id of a terminated thread that can no longer be joined.</p></li>\n</ol>\n</blockquote>\n<p><em>-- <a href=\"http://www.open-std.org/jtc1/sc22/wg21/docs/papers/2014/n4296.pdf\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">n4296</a>; 30.3.1.1 [thread.thread.id]</em></p>\n<p>It doesn't say that the ID is monotonically increasing, and it <strong>does</strong> permit thread IDs to be reused.</p>\n<p>It's likely that you want the <a href=\"http://en.cppreference.com/w/cpp/thread/thread/native_handle\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\"><code>native_handle</code></a>, which will be the handle that the underlying implementation uses. This will correspond to the Windows thread handle, under MSVC.

If you want to guarantee this, you'll need to have each thread increment an atomic counter, or otherwise obtain a monotonically increasing value with appropriate synchronisation.</p>\n</hr>", "LastEditorUserId": "3852968", "LastActivityDate": "2016-11-04T09:54:02.527", "Score": "3", "CreationDate": "2016-11-04T09:18:15.780", "ParentId": "40418833", "CommentCount": "6", "OwnerUserId": "3852968", "LastEditDate": "2016-11-04T09:54:02.527"}});
