You might already know that a <code>virtual</code> function incur some overhead as a class has to maintain a pointer to its implementation. In fact, an object contains a reference to a table of function pointers called the vtable. </p>\n<p>Consider the following example:</p>\n<pre><code>class Base\n{\npublic:\n    virtual f() { /* do something */ }\n}; \n\nclass Derived : public Base\n{\npublic:\n    virtual f() { /* do something */ }\n}; \n\nBase* a = new Derived;\na-&gt;f(); // calls Derived::f()\n</code></pre>\n<p>Note that the variable <code>a</code> points to a <code>Derived</code> object. As <code>f()</code> is declared <code>virtual</code> the vtable of <code>a</code> will contain a pointer to <code>Derived::f()</code> and that implementation is executed. If <code>f()</code> is not <code>virtual</code>, the vtable will be empty. So <code>Base::f()</code> is executed as the type of <code>a</code> is <code>Base</code>.</p>\n<p>A destructor behaves just like other member functions. If the destructor is not <code>virtual</code>, only the destructor in the <code>Base</code> class will be called. This might lead to memory/resource leaks if the <code>Derived</code> class implements <a href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Resource_Acquisition_Is_Initialization\" rel=\"nofollow\">RAII</a>. If a class is intended to be sub-classed, its destructor should be <code>virtual</code>.</p>\n<p>In some languages like Java all methods are virtual. So even objects that are not intended to be polymorphic will consume memory for maintaining the function pointers. In other words, you are forced to pay for what you don't use.</p>\n", "LastActivityDate": "2011-04-29T12:47:38.503", "CommentCount": "0", "CreationDate": "2011-04-29T12:47:38.503", "ParentId": "5831863", "Score": "1", "OwnerUserId": "133520"}, "5831909": {"Id": "5831909", "PostTypeId": "2", "Body": "<p>polymorphism is to allow your subclasses to override the default behaviour of base class functions, so unless you have virtual methods in your base class, you can't override methods in base.</p>\n", "LastActivityDate": "2011-04-29T12:17:40.643", "CommentCount": "10", "CreationDate": "2011-04-29T12:17:40.643", "ParentId": "5831863", "Score": "2", "OwnerUserId": "279982"}, "5832682": {"Id": "5832682", "PostTypeId": "2", "Body": "<p>Because it is defined as such in the standard.</p>\n<p>From 10.3/1 <strong>[class.virtual]</strong></p>\n<blockquote>\n<p id=\"so_5831863_5832682_0\">Virtual functions support dynamic binding and object-oriented programming.

To destruct a virtual class manually (via <code>delete</code>) through its base class you <em>need</em> a virtual destructor.
