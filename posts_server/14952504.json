But I'm not certain it's ever possible. Unless stated otherwise elsewhere in the standard I would assume for safety that calling a non-static member function inherently \"accesses the stored value of the object\" even if the function doesn't actually use any data members.</p>\n<p>This is one of those awkward cases that will probably work in practice either all the time or almost all the time. But it's not guaranteed, so even if it appears to work and the emitted code looks OK, you will live in fear that some day a new optimization will break it.</p>\n<p>Once defined, C++ classes are closed to new members, including new member functions. So your object created with <code>new A()</code> has all the member functions it will ever have. Just write a non-member function -- unless <code>A</code> has <code>protected</code> members it will have exactly the same access to <code>A</code> that your member function has. And if <code>A</code> does have <code>protected</code> members then there's an <em>approved</em> way of deriving from it, which you should use to create proper instances of <code>B</code>.</p>\n<p>If member function syntax means that much to you, then depending on the class <code>A</code> you might be able to write:</p>\n<pre><code>B b = *a;    // \"copy\" the object (give B a suitable ctor)\nb.method1(); // act on it\n*a = b;      // copy it back (A needs copy assignment operator)\n</code></pre>\n<p>Obviously there are issues here that could stop it working: to begin with whether the object is copyable, also thread-safety, and whether <code>method1</code> stores a pointer/reference to <code>b</code> somewhere that will start to dangle as soon as <code>b</code> is destroyed. In C++11 the copies could perhaps be moves for efficiency, but even so I hope you will agree that the hoops you have to jump through to use member function syntax <em>are not worth it</em>.</p>\n", "LastActivityDate": "2013-02-19T13:26:22.653"}, "14955015": {"ParentId": "14952504", "LastEditDate": "2013-02-19T11:01:55.800", "CommentCount": "2", "CreationDate": "2013-02-19T10:18:41.093", "OwnerUserId": "231388", "LastEditorUserId": "777186", "PostTypeId": "2", "Id": "14955015", "Score": "3", "Body": "<ol>\n<li>Yes, it is possible.</li>\n<li>No, it is not safe according to the standard; it is discouraged.</li>\n</ol>\n<p>This is more like C void* casting, which is not the best thing to do in C++.
