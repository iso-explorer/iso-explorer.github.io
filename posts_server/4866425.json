Therefore, your forward declaration with the struct class-key is erroneous.  I'm not aware of any part of the specification that allows a forward declaration to use a class-key that is clearly wrong.  I'm sure that the lenient compilers in question treat structs and classes equally and are glossing over the incorrect declaration.  An error may not be required from the compiler in this scenario, but neither should it be unexpected.</p>\n", "OwnerUserId": "214146", "PostTypeId": "2", "Id": "4866615", "Score": "3", "CreationDate": "2011-02-01T18:43:28.023", "LastActivityDate": "2011-02-01T18:43:28.023"}, "bq_ids": {"n4140": {"so_4866425_4866845_0": {"section_id": 5857, "quality": 1.0, "length": 21}}, "n3337": {"so_4866425_4866845_0": {"section_id": 5627, "quality": 1.0, "length": 21}}, "n4659": {"so_4866425_4866845_0": {"section_id": 7336, "quality": 1.0, "length": 21}}}, "4881444": {"ParentId": "4866425", "CommentCount": "0", "Body": "<p>Technically the code is ok, according to the language standard.
