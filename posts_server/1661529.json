To be threadsafe this would have to occur in a critical section, and but there's no requirement in the standard that a critical section be taken (the standard to date is completely silent on threads).  Compilers often implement this using a simple check and increment of a static boolean - but not in a critical section.  Something like the following pseudocode:</p>\n<pre><code>static Singleton&amp; instance()\n{\n    static bool initialized = false;\n    static char s[sizeof( Singleton)];\n\n    if (!initialized) {\n        initialized = true;\n\n        new( &amp;s) Singleton(); // call placement new on s to construct it\n    }\n\n    return (*(reinterpret_cast&lt;Singleton*&gt;( &amp;s)));\n}\n</code></pre>\n<p>So here's a simple thread-safe Singleton (for Windows).  It uses a simple class wrapper for the Windows CRITICAL_SECTION object so that we can have the compiler automatically initialize the <code>CRITICAL_SECTION</code> before <code>main()</code> is called.  Ideally a true RAII critical section class would be used that can deal with exceptions that might occur when the critical section is held, but that's beyond the scope of this answer.</p>\n<p>The fundamental operation is that when an instance of <code>Singleton</code> is requested, a lock is taken, the Singleton is created if it needs to be, then the lock is released and the Singleton reference returned.</p>\n<pre><code>#include &lt;windows.h&gt;\n\nclass CritSection : public CRITICAL_SECTION\n{\npublic:\n    CritSection() {\n        InitializeCriticalSection( this);\n    }\n\n    ~CritSection() {\n        DeleteCriticalSection( this);\n    }\n\nprivate:\n    // disable copy and assignment of CritSection\n    CritSection( CritSection const&amp;);\n    CritSection&amp; operator=( CritSection const&amp;);\n};\n\n\nclass Singleton\n{\npublic:\n    static Singleton&amp; instance();\n\nprivate:\n    // don't allow public construct/destruct\n    Singleton();\n    ~Singleton();\n    // disable copy &amp; assignment\n    Singleton( Singleton const&amp;);\n    Singleton&amp; operator=( Singleton const&amp;);\n\n    static CritSection instance_lock;\n};\n\nCritSection Singleton::instance_lock; // definition for Singleton's lock\n                                      //  it's initialized before main() is called\n\n\nSingleton::Singleton()\n{\n}\n\n\nSingleton&amp; Singleton::instance()\n{\n    // check to see if we need to create the Singleton\n    EnterCriticalSection( &amp;instance_lock);\n    static Singleton s;\n    LeaveCriticalSection( &amp;instance_lock);\n\n    return s;\n}\n</code></pre>\n<p>Man - that's a lot of crap to \"make a better global\".</p>\n<p>The main drawbacks to this implemention (if I didn't let some bugs slip through) is:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>if <code>new Singleton()</code> throws, the lock won't be released.  This can be fixed by using a true RAII lock object instead of the simple one I have here. This can also help make things portable if you use something like Boost to provide a platform independent wrapper for the lock.</li>\n<li>this guarantees thread safety when the Singleton instance is requested after <code>main()</code> is called - if you call it before then (like in a static object's initialization) things might not work because the <code>CRITICAL_SECTION</code> might not be initialized.</li>\n<li>a lock must be taken each time an instance is requested.  As I said, this is a simple thread safe implementation.
