But if you really want to go ahead, you have to keep prefixing the nested class with the <code>class</code> keyword. Where that's syntactically invalid, use a typedef:</p>\n<pre><code>class Foo\n{\npublic:\n    class Lock\n    {\n        // Operations that require the lock...\n    };\n\n    class Lock Lock() noexcept {\n      typedef class Lock cLock;\n      return cLock();\n    }\n};\n</code></pre>\n<p><a href=\"http://ideone.com/mFN8mz\" rel=\"nofollow\"><strong>Live example</strong></a></p>\n<p>As to the errors, clang is correct on this one.
