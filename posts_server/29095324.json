Standard headers are allowed to include other standard headers if they need them; and, since many headers contain inline function definitions, they will need the headers for anything used by those functions.</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p id=\"so_29095324_29098217_1\">why in Xcode, the <code>stdlib.h</code> has such a function\uff1f</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>It's a <a href=\"http://www.manpagez.com/man/3/mergesort/\" rel=\"nofollow\">BSD extension</a> to the standard library.</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p id=\"so_29095324_29098217_2\">Does it mean that the <code>stdlib.h</code> in Xcode is not a standard one?</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>It does indeed.</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p id=\"so_29095324_29098217_3\">How can I get a map of the dependency of every header file, for exemple, for a header file example.h, how can I know which other .h files are included in this exemple.h, and which other .h files include in themselves the file exemple.h.</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>Most compilers can output the dependencies of a translation unit.
