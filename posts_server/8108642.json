So due to overflow it should be a normal <code>int</code> inside the range to be reachable. To actually recognize that it cannot be reached from <code>int</code>, the compiler needs to know that it is 10 billion and therefore see it as a more-than-32-bit constant.</p>\n<p>Does such a literal get promoted to a fitting (or at least implementation-defined) range (at least 64-bit, in this case) automatically, even if not appended an <code>L</code> and is this standard behaviour? Or is something different going on behind the scenes, like UB due to overflow (is integer overflow actually UB)? Some quotes from the Standard may be nice, if any.</p>\n<p>Although the original question was C, I also appreciate C++ answers, if any different.</p>\n", "Tags": "<c++><c><overflow><literals>", "OwnerUserId": "743214", "AnswerCount": "3"}, "8108726": {"ParentId": "8108642", "PostTypeId": "2", "CommentCount": "3", "Body": "<blockquote>\n<p id=\"so_8108642_8108726_0\">I still wonder what was really going on inside the compiler</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>You can look at assembler, if you are interested in how the compiler interprets code.</p>\n<p>10000000000:</p>\n<pre><code>400054f:\nmov    -0x4(%rbp),%eax\nmov    %eax,-0x8(%rbp)\naddl   $0x1,-0x4(%rbp)\njmp    40054f &lt;main+0xb&gt;\n</code></pre>\n<p>so it just compiled it into infinite loop,\nif replace  10000000000 with 10000:</p>\n<pre><code>....\ntest   %al,%al\njne    400551\n</code></pre>\n", "OwnerUserId": "1034749", "LastEditorUserId": "597607", "LastEditDate": "2011-11-13T10:13:44.283", "Id": "8108726", "Score": "1", "CreationDate": "2011-11-13T00:48:26.320", "LastActivityDate": "2011-11-13T10:13:44.283"}, "8108715": {"ParentId": "8108642", "CommentCount": "1", "Body": "<p>From my draft of the C standard labeled <em>ISO/IEC 9899:TC2 Committee Draft \u2014 May 6, 2005</em>, the rules are remarkably similar to the C++ rules Matteo found:</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p id=\"so_8108642_8108715_0\">5  The type of an integer constant is the first of the corresponding list in which its value can be represented.</p>\n</blockquote>\n<pre><code>Suffix      Decimal Constant          Octal or Hexadecimal Constant\n-------------------------------------------------------------------\nnone        int                       int\n            long int                  unsigned int\n            long long int             long int\n                                      unsigned long int\n                                      long long int\n                                      unsigned long long int\n\nu or U      unsigned int              unsigned int\n            unsigned long int         unsigned long int\n            unsigned long long int    unsigned long long int\n\nl or L      long int                  long int\n            long long int             unsigned long int\n                                      long long int\n                                      unsigned long long int\nBoth u or U unsigned long int         unsigned long int\nand l or L  unsigned long long int    unsigned long long int\n\nll or LL    long long int             long long int\n                                      unsigned long long int\n\nBoth u or U unsigned long long int    unsigned long long int\nand ll or LL \n</code></pre>\n", "OwnerUserId": "377270", "PostTypeId": "2", "Id": "8108715", "Score": "8", "CreationDate": "2011-11-13T00:45:08.143", "LastActivityDate": "2011-11-13T00:45:08.143"}, "bq_ids": {"n4140": {"so_8108642_8108658_1": {"section_id": 5342, "quality": 1.0, "length": 12}, "so_8108642_8108658_2": {"section_id": 5341, "quality": 0.8181818181818182, "length": 9}, "so_8108642_8108658_0": {"section_id": 5341, "quality": 0.8333333333333334, "length": 10}, "so_8108642_8108715_0": {"section_id": 5341, "quality": 0.8181818181818182, "length": 9}}, "n3337": {"so_8108642_8108658_1": {"section_id": 5139, "quality": 1.0, "length": 12}, "so_8108642_8108658_2": {"section_id": 5138, "quality": 0.8181818181818182, "length": 9}, "so_8108642_8108658_0": {"section_id": 5138, "quality": 0.8333333333333334, "length": 10}, "so_8108642_8108715_0": {"section_id": 5138, "quality": 0.8181818181818182, "length": 9}}, "n4659": {"so_8108642_8108658_1": {"section_id": 6763, "quality": 1.0, "length": 12}, "so_8108642_8108658_2": {"section_id": 6762, "quality": 0.8181818181818182, "length": 9}, "so_8108642_8108658_0": {"section_id": 6762, "quality": 0.8333333333333334, "length": 10}, "so_8108642_8108715_0": {"section_id": 6762, "quality": 0.8181818181818182, "length": 9}}}});
