The bucket iterators are independent of each other, so each thread can process a bucket without co-ordination (provided no new entries are added to the container). And the buckets should be roughly the same size, so they provide a convenient parallelisation quantum.</p>\n", "LastEditorUserId": "1566221", "LastActivityDate": "2016-02-09T21:45:51.547", "Score": "8", "CreationDate": "2012-10-15T18:04:38.387", "ParentId": "12901346", "CommentCount": "5", "OwnerUserId": "1566221", "LastEditDate": "2016-02-09T21:45:51.547"}, "12901346": {"ViewCount": "392", "Body": "<p>If two keys for a std::unordered_map have the same hash value, is it guaranteed by the standard that they will go into the same bucket?
