Templated code is one place where <code>C::fun</code> may easily be called without the template author or user being very conscious of it.  To assess whether this is a genuine hazard for you, it would help to know what the functional purpose of \"fun\" is and how implementation might differ between <code>A</code>, <code>B</code> and <code>C</code>....</p>\n", "LastEditorUserId": "410767", "LastActivityDate": "2013-07-02T06:29:14.250", "Score": "1", "CreationDate": "2013-07-02T05:58:22.967", "ParentId": "17418057", "CommentCount": "0", "OwnerUserId": "410767", "LastEditDate": "2013-07-02T06:29:14.250"}, "bq_ids": {"n4140": {"so_17418057_17418213_0": {"length": 37, "quality": 0.9024390243902439, "section_id": 7003}}, "n3337": {"so_17418057_17418213_0": {"length": 37, "quality": 0.9024390243902439, "section_id": 6749}}, "n4659": {"so_17418057_17418213_0": {"length": 37, "quality": 0.9024390243902439, "section_id": 8500}}}, "17418084": {"Id": "17418084", "PostTypeId": "2", "Body": "<ul>\n<li>If you do not want your derived classes to override the function then there is no reason why you should mark it <code>virtual</code> in base class.
