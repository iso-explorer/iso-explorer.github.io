It has the same basic purpose, but doesn't try to list all the cases in the C++0x standard of operators whose operands aren't evaluated. <code>decltype</code> is a new one, for example.</p>\n<p>\"odr-used\" replaces \"used\", I presume they figured that \"used\" alone might be ambiguous with other uses of the word \"use\" in the standard.

Then in C++03 it is not used in the following statement:</p>\n<pre><code>char x[a];\n</code></pre>\n<p>because the context <em>requires</em> a constant expression. However, it is used in the following:</p>\n<pre><code>void foo(int); foo(a);\n</code></pre>\n<p>because the context doesn't require a constant expression.</p>\n<p>In C++0x, <code>a</code> is <em>not</em> odr-used in either case. It's allowed to be in a constant expression, and in the function call, lvalue-rvalue conversion is immediately applied (because <code>foo</code> takes its parameter by value, not reference). So it qualifies for the \"unless\" which wasn't present in C++03.</p>\n<p>There's also a difference in the definition of \"potentially evaluated\". In the first example, <code>char x[a]</code>, <code>a</code> is potentially evaluated in C++03 but not in C++0x. I haven't checked whether anything else in the standard uses \"potentially evaluated\", that might be affected by this change. If it's only mentioned here then that part of it isn't a change, it's just that the exception has been moved from \"potentially evaluated\" to \"used\".</p>\n", "LastEditorUserId": "13005", "LastActivityDate": "2011-04-06T12:20:28.797", "Score": "12", "CreationDate": "2011-04-06T11:39:17.817", "ParentId": "5565522", "CommentCount": "7", "OwnerUserId": "13005", "LastEditDate": "2011-04-06T12:20:28.797"}});
