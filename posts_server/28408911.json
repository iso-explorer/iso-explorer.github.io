If there is no user-declared constructor for class <code>X</code>, a constructor having no parameters is implicitly declared\n  as defaulted (8.4). An implicitly-declared default constructor is an inline public member of its class.

It happened to have been fixed to deal with <a href=\"http://www.open-std.org/jtc1/sc22/wg21/docs/cwg_defects.html#1507\">inaccessible trivial default constructors</a>, but the fixed wording also covers deleted trivial default constructors.
