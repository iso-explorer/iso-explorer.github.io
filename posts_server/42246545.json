So that means it can be used to measure the time between <code>t1</code> and <code>t2</code> even if <code>t2 &lt; t1</code>. And to do that simply, you need a negative value.</p>\n<p>If durations couldn't be signed then, to represent an offset that means \"earlier\" not \"later\", you'd have to use something like <code>std::pair&lt;bool, duration&gt;</code> where the <code>bool</code> says whether it's a positive or negative offset, and then you'd have to do:</p>\n<pre><code>chrono::time_point adjust(chrono::time_point t, pair&lt;bool, duration&gt; offset)\n{\n  if (offset.first)  // positive\n    return t + offset.second;\n  else // negative\n    return t - offset.second;\n}\n</code></pre>\n<p>This is dumb. The language and the hardware already support this far more expressively and efficiently, by using signed integers.</p>\n", "LastEditorUserId": "981959", "LastActivityDate": "2017-02-15T11:07:18.460", "Score": "7", "CreationDate": "2017-02-15T10:28:28.870", "ParentId": "42246545", "CommentCount": "1", "OwnerUserId": "981959", "LastEditDate": "2017-02-15T11:07:18.460"}, "bq_ids": {"n4140": {"so_42246545_42246733_0": {"length": 5, "quality": 0.7142857142857143, "section_id": 5790}}, "n3337": {"so_42246545_42246733_0": {"length": 5, "quality": 0.7142857142857143, "section_id": 5563}}, "n4659": {"so_42246545_42246733_0": {"length": 5, "quality": 0.7142857142857143, "section_id": 7247}}}, "42246727": {"Id": "42246727", "PostTypeId": "2", "Body": "<p>It is not just gcc implementation, it is required by the standard ([time.syn]):</p>\n<pre><code>typedef duration&lt;signed integer type of at least 64 bits,        nano&gt; nanoseconds;\n</code></pre>\n<p>A duration represents a time difference between two time points A and B.
