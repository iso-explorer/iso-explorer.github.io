The scope or body of <code>someFunc</code> has no means of accessing <code>foo</code>'s internals. Since the above functions are declared &amp; defined within <code>foo</code>'s scope this is valid.</p>\n<p>Trying to do this:</p>\n<pre><code>void someFunc() {\n    class boo {\n    private:\n        int x;\n    public:\n        int getX() const;\n        void setX( int val );\n    };\n\n    // These are illegal.

It can not access <code>boo::x</code>.</p>\n<p>It is illegal to declare a function within a function this can not be done because of the stack pointer for function scope. Functions are not like while &amp; for loops or switch statements which can be nested. A function's scope is a single translation unit within an object file after it's been compiled. You can have an empty scope within a function as that is valid, but you can not declare - define a function within another. </p>\n", "OwnerUserId": "1757805", "LastEditorUserId": "1757805", "LastEditDate": "2017-11-10T05:08:01.963", "Id": "46873642", "Score": "1", "CreationDate": "2017-10-22T11:42:44.657", "LastActivityDate": "2017-11-10T05:08:01.963"}, "bq_ids": {"n4140": {"so_46873142_46873181_0": {"section_id": 5930, "quality": 0.96, "length": 24}, "so_46873142_46873181_1": {"section_id": 3263, "quality": 1.0, "length": 5}}, "n3337": {"so_46873142_46873181_0": {"section_id": 5702, "quality": 0.96, "length": 24}, "so_46873142_46873181_1": {"section_id": 3135, "quality": 1.0, "length": 5}}, "n4659": {"so_46873142_46873181_0": {"section_id": 7415, "quality": 0.96, "length": 24}, "so_46873142_46873181_1": {"section_id": 4021, "quality": 1.0, "length": 5}}}, "46873142": {"CommentCount": "6", "AcceptedAnswerId": "46873181", "CreationDate": "2017-10-22T10:43:56.507", "LastActivityDate": "2017-11-10T05:08:01.963", "PostTypeId": "1", "ViewCount": "76", "FavoriteCount": "1", "Title": "What should i do to access member variable of an object?", "Id": "46873142", "Score": "1", "Body": "<pre><code>#include&lt;iostream&gt;\nusing namespace std;\nint main(){\n    class c1{\n        int i;\n\n        public:\n        int bv;\n        void seti(int i){\n            c1::i=i;\n                        }\n        int geti(){return i;}\n        int accessbv(c1 inst1);\n    };\n    int c1::accessbv (c1 inst1){\n        cout&lt;&lt;\"here in the base accesing inst1's bv\"&lt;&lt;inst1.bv;\n    }\n</code></pre>\n<p>I want to access inst1's member variable bv.The above code doesnt compile.
