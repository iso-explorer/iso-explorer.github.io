These objects are destroyed in the reverse order of the completion of their constructor or of the completion of their dynamic initialization. If an object is initialized statically, the object is destroyed in the same order as if the object was dynamically initialized. For an object of array or class type, all subobjects of that object are destroyed before any local object with static storage duration initialized during the construction of the sub- objects is destroyed.</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>Furthermore, \u00a7 9.4.2 7 states:</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p id=\"so_2204608_2204628_1\">Static data members are initialized and destroyed exactly like non-local objects (3.6.2, 3.6.3).</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>However, if a destructor has no observable behavior, it may not be invoked.
