For example I have written code that jumps out of a catch block, and it's used in a language's runtime library (for simplicity, the code that uses the runtime library does not implement the itanium exception handling, but is implemented using longjmp/setjmp). The runtime library however, through the C++ exceptions, <em>does</em> use it; and a mechanism is needed to cleanly transfer control between them.</p>\n<pre><code>try {\n  doSomethingThatMayFail();\n} catch(DiagnosticException&amp;) {\n  goto unwind;\n}\n\nif(0) {\nunwind:\n  longjmp(&amp;lastSafePoint, 0);\n}\n</code></pre>\n<p>I put this into a macro so that it's very convenient to write.
