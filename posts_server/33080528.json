I did a few tests, and it would seem that I do not have to \u2014 i.e., when an instance of A goes out of scope or is deleted (or reset, if I reference it through a shared_ptr), the string is deleted as well (I played with a more sophisticated example to confirm this). However, this could be implementation specific to the compiler that I am using (clang-700.0.72).</p>\n<p>My question is: is this always the case, or is it better to explicitly reset those instances like I would delete any other dumb pointer?</p>\n", "Tags": "<c++><c++11><destructor><shared-ptr>", "OwnerUserId": "554491", "AnswerCount": "3"}, "33080560": {"ParentId": "33080528", "PostTypeId": "2", "CommentCount": "8", "Body": "<p>No, that's the main point of smart pointers: <strong>to manage memory automatically</strong>.</p>\n<p>The destructor of <code>shared_ptr</code> will automatically decrease the reference count, and if it reaches 0, will call the deleter.</p>\n<p>If you don't provide a destructor, a default one will be generated:</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p id=\"so_33080528_33080560_0\"><strong>\u00a7 12.4.4</strong> If a class has no user-declared destructor, a destructor is implicitly declared as defaulted</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>The destruction of your class will guarantee the destruction of members.</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p id=\"so_33080528_33080560_1\"><strong>\u00a7 12.4.8</strong> After executing the body of the destructor and destroying any automatic objects allocated within the body, a destructor for class X calls the destructors for X's direct non-variant non-static data members(...)</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>Which in turn for <code>shared_ptr</code> means:</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p id=\"so_33080528_33080560_2\"><strong>\u00a7 20.8.2.2.2.1</strong></p>\n<p id=\"so_33080528_33080560_3\"><code>~shared_ptr();</code></p>\n<p id=\"so_33080528_33080560_4\">Effects:</p>\n<ul>\n<li><p id=\"so_33080528_33080560_5\">If *this is empty or shares ownership with another shared_ptr instance (use_count() &gt; 1), there are no side effects.</p></li>\n<li><p id=\"so_33080528_33080560_6\">Otherwise, if *this owns an object p and a deleter d, d(p) is called.</p></li>\n<li><p id=\"so_33080528_33080560_7\">Otherwise, *this owns a pointer p, and delete p is called.</p></li>\n</ul>\n</blockquote>\n<p>This behaviour is nicely summarized as <a href=\"https://rmf.io/cxx11/rule-of-zero/\" rel=\"nofollow\">The Rule Of Zero</a>.</p>\n", "OwnerUserId": "752976", "LastEditorUserId": "752976", "LastEditDate": "2015-10-12T12:10:36.660", "Id": "33080560", "Score": "4", "CreationDate": "2015-10-12T11:58:46.293", "LastActivityDate": "2015-10-12T12:10:36.660"}, "33080572": {"ParentId": "33080528", "CommentCount": "0", "Body": "<p>No, you do not need to do so.
