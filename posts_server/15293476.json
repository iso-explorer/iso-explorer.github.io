If an exception is thrown after another exception has been thrown, but before that exception has been caught by a <code>catch</code> handler, your program will be forced to terminate abruptly.</p>\n<p>Since destructors are invoked during stack unwinding when an exception is thrown, if one of them throws another exception, that will immediately terminate your program. Not nice.</p>\n<p>Avoid throwing exceptions from destructors (or wrap them into <code>try</code>/<code>catch</code> blocks so you do not <em>propagate</em> them outside the destructor). Doing so is a <em>bad</em> programming practice.</p>\n<p>From Paragraph 15.2/3 of the C++11 Standard:</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p id=\"so_15293476_15293597_1\">The process of calling destructors for automatic objects constructed on the path from a try block to the\n  point where an exception is thrown is called \u201cstack unwinding.\u201d If a destructor called during stack unwinding\n  exits with an exception, std::terminate is called (15.5.1).
