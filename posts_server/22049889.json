A character literal that does not begin with <code>L</code> is an ordinary character literal, also referred to as a narrow-character literal. An ordinary character literal that contains a single c-char has type char, with value equal to the numerical value of the encoding of the c-char in the execution character set. <strong>An ordinary character literal that contains more than one c-char is a multicharacter literal.
