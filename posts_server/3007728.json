Page 78 says:</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p id=\"so_3007728_11237362_0\">An xvalue (an \u201ceXpiring\u201d value) also refers to an object, usually near\n  the end of its lifetime (so that its resources may be moved, for\n  example). <strong>An xvalue is the result of certain kinds of expressions\n  involving rvalue references</strong> (8.3.2).</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>The bold above has been added by me. The standard further says:</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p id=\"so_3007728_11237362_1\">An rvalue (so called, historically, because rvalues could appear on\n  the right-hand side of an assignment expression) is an xvalue, a\n  temporary object (12.2) or subobject thereof, or a value that is not\n  associated with an object.</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>So you only get an xvalue when you are playing around with 'certain kinds of expressions involving rvalue references'. Otherwise your temporary objects are just that - temporary objects.</p>\n", "CommentCount": "1", "LastEditorUserId": "1090657", "LastActivityDate": "2012-10-20T01:46:29.497", "CreationDate": "2012-06-28T02:35:28.610", "ParentId": "3007728", "Score": "0", "OwnerUserId": "1487337", "LastEditDate": "2012-10-20T01:46:29.497"}, "bq_ids": {"n4140": {"so_3007728_11237362_1": {"length": 19, "quality": 0.95, "section_id": 7230}, "so_3007728_3007728_0": {"length": 9, "quality": 1.0, "section_id": 7230}, "so_3007728_11237362_0": {"length": 23, "quality": 0.92, "section_id": 7230}}, "n3337": {"so_3007728_11237362_1": {"length": 19, "quality": 0.95, "section_id": 6974}, "so_3007728_3007728_0": {"length": 9, "quality": 1.0, "section_id": 6974}, "so_3007728_11237362_0": {"length": 23, "quality": 0.92, "section_id": 6974}}}, "3007728": {"ViewCount": "377", "Body": "<p>It took me quite some time to understand the difference between an rvalue and a temporary object.

Expressions are not objects, but their evaluation might yield one. Specifically, the evaluation of a prvalue yields a temporary object, but a prvalue IS NOT a temporary object.
