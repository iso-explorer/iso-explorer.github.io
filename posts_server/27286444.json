[...] Otherwise\n  such a variable is initialized the first time control passes through\n  its declaration; such a variable is considered initialized upon the\n  completion of its initialization. If the initialization exits by\n  throwing an exception, the initialization is not complete, so it will\n  be tried again the next time control enters the declaration. <strong>If\n  control enters the declaration concurrently while the variable is\n  being initialized, the concurrent execution shall wait for completion\n  of the initialization.</strong> [...]</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>while pre C++11 section <code>6.7</code> says:</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p id=\"so_27286444_27286579_1\">[...]Otherwise such an object is initialized the first time control passes\n  through its declaration; such an object is considered initialized upon\n  the completion of its initialization.
