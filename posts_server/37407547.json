The problem in this case is that writting </p>\n<pre><code>external int a;\nauto a = 3;\n</code></pre>\n<p>is the same as writting </p>\n<pre><code>external int a;\nint a = 3;\n</code></pre>\n<p>that means you have a new definition of a and that causes an error.</p>\n<p>First answer:\nFor my understanding this breaks parts of the One definition rule. Specifically, I mean the following rule (in reference to MISRA C++ 2008) that says that an identifier with external linkage should always have only one definition. In your example you have a definition in the current file(<code>auto a = 3;</code>) and with external you also refer to a definition in another file.</p>\n", "LastActivityDate": "2016-05-24T09:54:21.123"}, "37407547": {"CommentCount": "9", "ViewCount": "360", "PostTypeId": "1", "ClosedDate": "2016-05-24T09:35:41.277", "LastEditorUserId": "3953764", "LastActivityDate": "2016-05-24T09:54:21.123", "Body": "<p>Is the following allowed by the standard?</p>\n<pre><code>#include &lt;iostream&gt;\n\nextern int a;\nauto a = 3;\n\nint main(int, char**)\n{\n    std::cout &lt;&lt; a &lt;&lt; std::endl;\n    return 0;\n}\n</code></pre>\n<p><a href=\"http://melpon.org/wandbox/permlink/FSxXLayFv9fGwU5u\">clang</a> accepts the code.\n<a href=\"http://melpon.org/wandbox/permlink/EveSqAvJokWKOG4G\">g++</a> complains for conflicting declaration.</p>\n", "LastEditDate": "2016-05-24T07:57:55.130", "FavoriteCount": "3", "Title": "Can a variable be redeclared as auto that deduced to the same type?", "Id": "37407547", "Score": "16", "CreationDate": "2016-05-24T07:57:07.433", "Tags": "<c++><c++11><language-lawyer><extern><auto>", "OwnerUserId": "2969631", "AnswerCount": "2"}, "bq_ids": {"n4140": {"so_37407547_37408242_0": {"section_id": 5450, "quality": 0.6363636363636364, "length": 7}}, "n3337": {"so_37407547_37408242_0": {"section_id": 5244, "quality": 0.6363636363636364, "length": 7}}, "n4659": {"so_37407547_37408242_0": {"section_id": 6877, "quality": 0.6363636363636364, "length": 7}}}});
