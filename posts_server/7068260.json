And yes, it can be deduced that <code>:::</code> will be parsed as <code>::</code> followed by <code>:</code>. It's a purely lexical issue. As in C++03, the token is taken as the longest possible one. In C++03 that led template closing <code>&gt;&gt;</code>s to be considered as shift operator. In C++0x an exception had been made for this special case, but the general rule still applies (See 2.5.3). For example +++ will be parsed as ++ followed by +, not vice versa</p>\n", "LastActivityDate": "2011-08-15T17:29:51.587", "CommentCount": "1", "CreationDate": "2011-08-15T17:29:51.587", "ParentId": "7068260", "Score": "6", "OwnerUserId": "469935"}});
