So, from Bjarne Stroustrup's book, can I say that it is conceptually true that they have constructors but practically there is no such thing like constructor exist for built in types? Is it really flawed text in his book? Or if it really true according to Bjarne Stroustrup's book when they are actually gets called &amp; used?</p>\n", "LastEditDate": "2017-05-23T10:26:56.870", "FavoriteCount": "2", "Title": "When actually primitive type constructor gets called & used?", "Id": "30714156", "Score": "7", "CreationDate": "2015-06-08T16:10:28.350", "Tags": "<c++><constructor><primitive-types><built-in-types>", "OwnerUserId": "3777958", "AnswerCount": "0"}, "bq_ids": {"n4140": {"so_30714156_30714156_0": {"section_id": 5559, "quality": 0.5714285714285714, "length": 4}}, "n3337": {"so_30714156_30714156_0": {"section_id": 5341, "quality": 0.5714285714285714, "length": 4}}, "n4659": {"so_30714156_30714156_0": {"section_id": 7006, "quality": 0.5714285714285714, "length": 4}}}});
