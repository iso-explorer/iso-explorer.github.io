But here is the <em>correct</em> answer again.</p>\n<p>Java methods and C++ virtual functions <em>can</em> be hidden, but different return types <em>are</em> allowed when overriding, as long as they are <em>compatible</em>. It is only <em>conflicting</em> return types that are disallowed. For example, in C++:</p>\n<pre><code>struct Base {\n    virtual Base* f() { return nullptr; }\n};\n\nstruct Derived : Base {\n    Derived* f() override { return nullptr; }\n};\n</code></pre>\n<p>And in Java:</p>\n<pre><code>class Base {\n    Base f() { return null; }\n}\n\nclass Derived extends Base {\n    @Override\n    Derived f() { return null; }\n}\n</code></pre>\n", "LastActivityDate": "2016-03-12T17:10:57.790"}, "35958933": {"ParentId": "35958755", "PostTypeId": "2", "CommentCount": "0", "CreationDate": "2016-03-12T14:33:47.883", "Score": "3", "LastEditorUserId": "3309790", "LastEditDate": "2016-03-12T15:06:13.820", "Id": "35958933", "OwnerUserId": "3309790", "Body": "<blockquote>\n<p id=\"so_35958755_35958933_0\">If it polymorphic behavior problem.

It's conflicting and ill-formed.</p>\n<p>From the c++ standard, $10.3/7 Virtual functions [class.virtual]</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p id=\"so_35958755_35958933_2\">The return type of an overriding function shall be either identical to\n  the return type of the overridden function or covariant with the\n  classes of the functions.</p>\n</blockquote>\n", "LastActivityDate": "2016-03-12T15:06:13.820"}, "35958755": {"CommentCount": "3", "AcceptedAnswerId": "35959005", "PostTypeId": "1", "LastEditorUserId": "2769917", "CreationDate": "2016-03-12T14:19:41.850", "LastActivityDate": "2016-03-12T17:10:57.790", "LastEditDate": "2016-03-12T15:17:42.723", "ViewCount": "88", "FavoriteCount": "1", "Title": "Why hiding of virtual functions/methods not allowed in Java or C++", "Id": "35958755", "Score": "4", "Body": "<pre><code>#include &lt;iostream&gt;\nclass A{\n    public:\n        void k(){\n            std::cout &lt;&lt; \"k from A\";\n        }\n};\nclass B:public A{\n    public:\n        int k(){\n            std::cout &lt;&lt; \"k from B\"; \n            return 0;\n        }\n};\nint main(){\n    B obj;\n    obj.k();\n\n    return 0;\n}\n</code></pre>\n<p>without virtual it's working fine, But When I changed A's function to virtual then It's saying return type should be same why?</p>\n<p>I tried same thing in Java.</p>\n<pre><code>class X{\n    public void k(){\n        System.out.println(\"k From X\");\n    }\n}\npublic class Y{\n    public int k(){\n        System.out.println(\"k From Y\");\n        return 0;\n    }\n}\n</code></pre>\n<p>Java also showing error when I tried different return type in sub-class.
