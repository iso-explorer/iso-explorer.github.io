It does not leave any room for anything else, like namespaces, to affect the order.</p>\n<p>Actually, \"Global variables are initialized in order ...\" is imprecise quotation of the standard as is formally wrong. The exact wording from C++ Standard, ISO/IEC 14882:2003, 3.6.2 paragraph 1 is:</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p id=\"so_8353414_8353464_0\">Objects with static storage duration defined in namespace scope in the same translation\n  unit and dynamically initialized shall be initialized in the order in which their definition appears in the translation unit.</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>So rather than \"global\" it says \"with static storage\", that is all non-local variables whether they are global, namespace members or class members and whether they are declared <code>static</code> or not.</p>\n<p>Also it adds \"and dynamically initialized\". Variables with trivial constructors and constant initializer are always initialized first (by simply loading their values from the binary) and than all non-constant initializers are evaluated and non-trivial constructors are run in that order. This is important, so you can for example reliably create a linked list in those constructors; if it's head is plain pointer, it is already initialized, so you can safely work with it.</p>\n", "LastActivityDate": "2013-09-26T05:37:01.650"}, "8353482": {"ParentId": "8353414", "PostTypeId": "2", "CommentCount": "2", "CreationDate": "2011-12-02T08:13:51.123", "Score": "11", "LastEditorUserId": "964135", "LastEditDate": "2011-12-02T08:23:44.003", "Id": "8353482", "OwnerUserId": "964135", "Body": "<blockquote>\n<p id=\"so_8353414_8353482_0\">3.6 Other non-local variables with static storage duration have ordered initialization.
