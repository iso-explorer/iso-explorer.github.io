If the first overload resolution fails or was not\n  performed, or if the type of the first parameter of the selected\n  constructor is not an rvalue reference to the object\u2019s type (possibly\n  cv-qualified), overload resolution is performed again, considering the\n  object as an lvalue. [<em>Note:</em> This two-stage overload resolution must\n  be performed regardless of whether copy elision will occur. It\n  determines the constructor to be called if elision is not performed,\n  and the selected constructor must be accessible even if the call is\n  elided. <em>\u2014 end note</em> ]</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>Applying <code>std::move</code> is not superfluous but actually <strong>prevents</strong> copy elision from being performed, [class.copy]/31:</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p id=\"so_27695528_27698437_1\">\u2014 in a <code>return</code> statement in a function with a class return type, when\n  the expression is <strong>the name of a non-volatile automatic object</strong> [..]</p>\n</blockquote></li>\n<li><p>Yes, one situation - Again I assume you meant that if copy elision isn't performed, a move is done (Copy elision must be applicable if the lvalue is moved, s.a.).<br>\nConsider this:</br></p>\n<pre><code>A a;\nthrow a;\n</code></pre>\n<p>The criteria are met:</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p id=\"so_27695528_27698437_2\">\u2014 in a <em>throw-expression</em>, when the operand is the name of a\n  non-volatile automatic object (other than a function or catch-clause\n  parameter) whose scope does not extend beyond the end of the innermost\n  enclosing try-block (if there is one), the copy/move operation from\n  the operand to the exception object (15.1) can be omitted by\n  constructing the automatic object directly into the exception object</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p><a href=\"http://coliru.stacked-crooked.com/a/9a0f51e88400f458\" rel=\"nofollow\"><strong>Demo</strong></a>.<br>\nThis is the only other case where an lvalue is moved instead of copied; The other two cases for copy elision solely include temporaries not bound to a reference (which must therefore be designated by prvalues) and the exception-declaration thingy, which is uninteresting here as it covers the exception object we don't see.</br></p></li>\n</ol>\n", "OwnerUserId": "3647361", "LastEditorUserId": "701092", "LastEditDate": "2014-12-30T02:10:09.117", "Id": "27698437", "Score": "4", "CreationDate": "2014-12-30T01:24:41.617", "LastActivityDate": "2014-12-30T02:10:09.117"}, "27695528": {"CommentCount": "13", "CreationDate": "2014-12-29T20:26:46.273", "PostTypeId": "1", "AcceptedAnswerId": "27698437", "LastEditorUserId": "598465", "LastActivityDate": "2014-12-30T12:13:26.963", "LastEditDate": "2014-12-30T12:13:26.963", "ViewCount": "150", "FavoriteCount": "1", "Title": "When are lvalues moved instead of copied in C++?", "Id": "27695528", "Score": "6", "Body": "<p>Given the following:</p>\n<pre><code>Foo getFoo()\n{\n    Foo result = doSomeWork();\n    return result;\n}\n</code></pre>\n<ul>\n<li><p>Does C++ guarantee that <code>result</code> will be moved, instead of copied?
