Using an always <code>true</code> condition in a <code>while</code> loop is probably an error. For exemple, in the following code, this is probably a bug, and I'd like the compiler to warn me about it:</p>\n<pre><code>unsigned int x;\n// ...\nwhile (x &gt;= 0) {\n    // ...\n}\n</code></pre>\n<p>In such a situation, in optimized build the compiler will probably deduce that the condition is always true (since an unsigned integer cannot be smaller than 0).
