For example, if a pointer occupies 64 bits in a particular implementation, then <code>max_size()</code> could safely return 2<sup>64</sup>-1. In fact it could be rather less than this, since each linked list node will be bigger than 1 byte.</p>\n", "LastActivityDate": "2014-12-16T16:23:21.523"}, "27508950": {"ParentId": "27508872", "CommentCount": "3", "Body": "<blockquote>\n<p id=\"so_27508872_27508950_0\">If <code>std::list</code> is a linked list then why is there a limit on how many elements you can have?</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>Because the <code>max_size()</code> function is a requirement for all standard containers.</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p id=\"so_27508872_27508950_1\">Each element is a link to a new node and there's no limit on how many pointers you can have.</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>Yes there is: the size must be representable by <code>size_type</code>, so a limit is that type's maximum value.

Algorithms are written as templates, so they basically duck type code, they expect some contracts to be fulfilled (i.e. providing some API). There are algorithms written for all containers so they expect whatever is passed as a container to implement full API, even if sometimes a particular method does not have much <em>theoretical</em> sense it must be implemented.</p>\n<p>That said, <em>technically</em> there is an upper bound anyway so it's good idea to use it in such cases.
