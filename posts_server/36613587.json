When strictly speaking about the C++ 14 standard, using data with thread_local storage from a signal handler results in undefined behavior.</p>\n<p>On certain platforms, however, such use might be permissible. For example, most POSIX systems implement thread-local storage by using a special data segment that is allocated per-thread (like the stack). Please refer to <a href=\"https://www.akkadia.org/drepper/tls.pdf\" rel=\"nofollow\">this document</a> for detailed explanations. In this case, access to thread-local data is async signal safe because it does not involve any locks.</p>\n<p>However, the data read or written by the signal handler might still be inconsistent unless only atomics are accessed or access is fenced by using <code>std::atomic_signal_fence</code>. The reason for this is that the compiler has now idea when a signal handler might interrupt execution and might thus reorder read and write instructions. <code>std::atomic_signal_fence</code> prohibits this reordering and reordering by the CPU is not a problem because the execution happens within the same thread and the CPU is only allowed to reorder instructions when the result (within the thread) is the same as if the instructions had been executed in order.</p>\n<p>In addition to std::atomic_signal_fence, using variables of type std::atomic is safe, as long they are lock free (as indicated by std::is_lock_free).</p>\n<p>On Linux (and I believe most other POSIX platforms), the question whether a signal is dispatched to a specific thread depends on how this signal is generated and the exact type of the signal. For example, <code>SIGSEGV</code> and <code>SIGBUS</code> are always dispatched to the thread that caused the error resulting in the signal. In this case, using thread-local storage can be a convenient way to recover from such errors. However, there is no way to do this while keeping the code portable to all platforms supporting the C++ standard.</p>\n", "LastActivityDate": "2016-06-30T11:03:07.610", "CommentCount": "0", "CreationDate": "2016-06-30T11:03:07.610", "ParentId": "36613587", "Score": "0", "OwnerUserId": "2326830"}, "36613587": {"ViewCount": "109", "Body": "<p>Let's assume that I have this function: </p>\n<pre><code>int my_thread_id(){\n  static int counter {0};\n  thread_local int tid{++counter};\n  return tid;\n}\n</code></pre>\n<p>Is this function (my_thread_id) async-signal-safe, even on the first call? </p>\n", "AcceptedAnswerId": "36613757", "Title": "is static thread_local memory async signal safet in c++14?", "CreationDate": "2016-04-14T03:53:47.857", "Id": "36613587", "CommentCount": "0", "LastEditDate": "2016-04-14T04:13:36.153", "PostTypeId": "1", "LastEditorUserId": "636019", "LastActivityDate": "2016-06-30T11:03:07.610", "Score": "1", "OwnerUserId": "2856298", "Tags": "<c++><c++11><signals><c++14>", "AnswerCount": "2"}});
