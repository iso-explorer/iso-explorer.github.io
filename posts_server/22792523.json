Thanks to all who participated in the discussion. I also thank <a href=\"https://stackoverflow.com/users/567292/ecatmur\">@ecatmur</a> for his exact but too serious answer.</p>\n<p>I wanted to get the code that would have looked strange and at the same time would have compiled with one compiler at least (because it would have given respectability to my question). So my goal was not to create a standard-compliant code. But as <a href=\"https://stackoverflow.com/users/34509/johannes-schaub-litb\"><strong>@Johannes Schaub - litb</strong></a> noted in comments this code has at least one problem which make it ill-formed. The line <code>virtual override override;</code> is a violation the following rule (see paragraph [basic.scope.class] 3.3.7/1 of the standard):</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p id=\"so_22792523_22792523_0\">A name <code>N</code> used in a class <code>S</code> shall refer to the same declaration in its context and when re-evaluated in the completed scope of <code>S</code>. No diagnostic is required for a violation of this rule.</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>As I can see it can be rewritten as <code>virtual ::final::override override;</code> to become a standard-compliant.</p>\n", "AcceptedAnswerId": "22792872", "Title": "C++11 code with inheritance doesn't compile with clang", "CreationDate": "2014-04-01T17:14:30.363", "Id": "22792523", "CommentCount": "16", "FavoriteCount": "2", "PostTypeId": "1", "LastEditDate": "2017-05-23T12:12:57.737", "LastEditorUserId": "-1", "LastActivityDate": "2014-04-16T12:33:51.847", "Score": "8", "OwnerUserId": "3043539", "Tags": "<c++><inheritance><c++11><clang>", "AnswerCount": "1"}});
