If the initializations are in the same translation unit, their dynamic initializations are the order of those object definitions.  The compiler is allowed to initialize <code>b</code> as a static initialization instead if it can figure out how (per 3.6.2/3).  So the first program may or may not invoke undefined behavior, and is probably a bad idea.</p>\n<p>For dynamic storage duration, note 3.7.2/2:</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p id=\"so_13110522_13111285_0\">A variable with thread storage duration shall be initialized before its first odr-use (3.2) and, if constructed, shall be destroyed on thread exit.</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>So thread-local variables act more like function-local static variables than namespace-scope static variables.
