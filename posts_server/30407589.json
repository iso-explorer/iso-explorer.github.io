Otherwise, if <code>E1</code> has a signed type and non-negative value, and <code>E1</code>\u00d7<code>2</code><sup>E2</sup> is representable in the corresponding unsigned type of the result type, then that value, converted to the result type, is the\n  resulting value; otherwise, the behavior is undefined.</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>Any (odd number &gt; 1) x 2<sup>31</sup> is not representable by <code>uint32_t</code>, so the behavior is undefined. Your compiler apparently chooses to implement this as a segmentation fault, which is perfectly conforming behavior (edit: er, at least it would be, if that were where it is happening). </p>\n<p>A more typical approach would be just to let bits \"fall off\" the end. That is, <code>a &lt;&lt; 31</code> for an odd number would become <code>0x80000000</code>. But even in that case, another left-shift of 1 would result in <code>0</code>, so you'd have to subtract 1 to get <code>-1</code>, not add <code>1</code>. </p>\n", "LastActivityDate": "2015-05-23T00:26:06.953"}, "30407589": {"CommentCount": "9", "ViewCount": "209", "PostTypeId": "1", "LastEditorUserId": "4799108", "CreationDate": "2015-05-23T00:16:41.203", "LastActivityDate": "2015-05-23T00:49:05.600", "Title": "Need some help - left shift bitwise operator", "AcceptedAnswerId": "30407756", "LastEditDate": "2015-05-23T00:46:15.667", "Id": "30407589", "Score": "1", "Body": "<p>I am trying to clearly understand the behaviour of the shift operators (especially for the boundary cases), so I devised a little test written in C++.</p>\n<pre><code>    int a = odd_value; //321 in my case but it should not matter (the last bit to be 1)\n    print(0, a);\n\n    a = a &lt;&lt; 31; // (this gives a segmentation fault, as normal because it tries the sign bit becomes 1 but all the other bits are 0).\n    print(0, a); //the segmentation fault happens here - it prints the minimum integer value and then gives the fault\n    a = (a &lt;&lt; 1) + 1; // but if then I do this, shouldn't it set a to -1 ??\n    print(a); //gives 0\n\n   void print(int stackCallIndex, int nb)\n   {\n     if(nb)\n     {\n        print(++stackCallIndex, nb &gt;&gt; 1);\n        if(nb &amp; 1) printf(\"%d\", 1);\n        else       printf(\"%d\", 0);\n\n        if(stackCallIndex % 8 == 0) printf(\" \");\n     }\n   }\n</code></pre>\n", "Tags": "<c++><bit-manipulation><operators>", "OwnerUserId": "4799108", "AnswerCount": "3"}, "30407756": {"ParentId": "30407589", "PostTypeId": "2", "CommentCount": "5", "CreationDate": "2015-05-23T00:45:26.963", "Score": "3", "LastEditorUserId": "1942027", "LastEditDate": "2015-05-23T00:49:05.600", "Id": "30407756", "OwnerUserId": "1942027", "Body": "<p>According to your code I'd bet on a stackoverflow due to infinite recursion if you try to print negative values.</p>\n<pre><code>   void print(int stackCallIndex, int nb)\n   {\n     if(number)\n     {\n        print(++stackCallIndex, nb &gt;&gt; 1); // likely an infinite recursion here.\n        if(nb &amp; 1) printf(\"%d\", 1);\n        else       printf(\"%d\", 0);\n\n        if(stackCallIndex % 8 == 0) printf(\" \");\n     }\n   }\n</code></pre>\n<p>so why would it be infinite recursion?
