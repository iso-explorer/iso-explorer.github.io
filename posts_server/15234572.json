They are not guaranteed to be initialized before <code>main</code> is called if <code>main</code> is in a different translation unit.  <code>inline</code> functions are duplicated, where each translation unit has it's own copy.  That means that inline functions in different translation units than the <code>static</code> variable might attempt to read/write to that variable before it is properly initialized, resulting in undefined behavior.
