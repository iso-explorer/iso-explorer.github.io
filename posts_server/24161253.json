The Standard actually goes into some depth about this. 12.3.2/1:</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p id=\"so_24161253_24161758_0\">A conversion function is never used to convert a (possibly cv-qualified) object to the (possibly cv-qualified) same object type (or a reference to it), to a (possibly cv-qualified) base class of that type (or a reference to it), or to (possibly cv-qualified) void.</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>And in a footnote,</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p id=\"so_24161253_24161758_1\">These conversions are considered as standard conversions for the purposes of overload resolution (13.3.3.1, 13.3.3.1.4) and therefore initialization (8.5) and explicit casts (5.2.9). A conversion to void does not invoke any conversion function (5.2.9). Even though never directly called to perform a conversion, <strong>such conversion functions can be declared and can potentially be reached through a call to a virtual conversion function in a base class.</strong></p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>Also, conversion functions are still normal functions and can be called explicitly by name.</p>\n<p>The note about virtual functions applies to code like this:</p>\n<pre><code>class B;\n\nstruct A {\n    virtual operator B() const = 0;\n};\n\nstruct B : A\n{\n    public:\n        operator B() const{ return B(); } // virtual override\n\n    private:\n        int m_i;\n};\n\nA const &amp; q = B(); // q has dynamic type B, static type A\nB r = q; // Convert A to B using B::operator B()\n</code></pre>\n<p>Pedantic note: \"conversion operator\" is poor terminology. These are known as <em>conversion functions</em> and they are not considered to be a case of operator overloading, despite the <code>operator</code> keyword.</p>\n", "LastActivityDate": "2014-06-12T00:49:24.020"}});
