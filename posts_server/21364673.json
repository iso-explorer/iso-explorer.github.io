As far as C++ is concerned, a byte is always a char, but the number of bits it holds is platform-dependent (and available in <code>CHAR_BITS</code>). Sometimes you want to say \"a byte is eight bits\", in which case you get a different meaning, and that may have been the intended meaning in the phrase \"a char has four bytes\".</p></li>\n<li><p>The execution character set may very well be larger than or incompatible with the input character set provided by the environment. Trigraphs and alternate tokens exist to allow the representation of execution-set characters with fewer input characters on such restricted platforms (e.g. <code>not</code> is identical for all purposes to <code>!</code>, and the latter is not available in all character sets or keyboard layouts).</p></li>\n</ul>\n", "OwnerUserId": "596781", "PostTypeId": "2", "Id": "21364848", "Score": "1", "CreationDate": "2014-01-26T14:51:40.577", "LastActivityDate": "2014-01-26T14:51:40.577"}, "21364673": {"CommentCount": "9", "ViewCount": "155", "PostTypeId": "1", "LastEditorUserId": "3237645", "CreationDate": "2014-01-26T14:35:11.193", "LastActivityDate": "2014-01-26T15:32:01.323", "Title": "What assumption is safe for a C++ implementation's character set?", "AcceptedAnswerId": "21364848", "LastEditDate": "2014-01-26T14:42:56.240", "Id": "21364673", "Score": "2", "Body": "<p>In The C++ Programming Language 6.2.3, it says:</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p id=\"so_21364673_21364673_0\">It is safe to assume that the implementation character set includes\n  the decimal digits, the 26 alphabetic characters of English, and some\n  of the basic punctuation characters.
