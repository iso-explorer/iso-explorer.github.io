For example, in the old DOS days, you'd regularly poke around there - that's where the interrupt table started - so if you wanted to know what would run on a keypress or timer interrupt then you could create a pointer to an array of pointers, and point <em>that</em> at 0.  I reviewed the wording in the C++ Standard a couple years ago to see if this is necessarily undefined behaviour on a system where address 0 should be accessible (at a CPU/architecture level), and my recollection is that it wasn't explicit in saying this would cause undefined behaviour.  Still, it basically reserves the right to load a non-0 value when you put 0 into a pointer, compare a pointer to 0 etc: 0 is a special sentinel value that it can do whatever it likes with, so if you cared about going \"by the book\" then you'd have to pussy-foot around.</p>\n", "OwnerUserId": "410767", "PostTypeId": "2", "Id": "3932143", "Score": "3", "CreationDate": "2010-10-14T10:18:02.977", "LastActivityDate": "2010-10-14T10:18:02.977"}, "3932081": {"CommentCount": "0", "ViewCount": "341", "CreationDate": "2010-10-14T10:09:10.827", "LastActivityDate": "2010-10-14T14:43:43.320", "Title": "Is there any physical part of memory with the address of NULL(0)?", "AcceptedAnswerId": "3932123", "PostTypeId": "1", "Id": "3932081", "Score": "3", "Body": "<p>I know there's an old saying when you want to indicate this specific pointer doesn't point to anything it should be set to NULL(actually 0), but I'm wondering isn't there actually a physical part of memory with the address of NULL(0) ?</p>\n", "Tags": "<c++><memory><pointers><null>", "OwnerUserId": "388056", "AnswerCount": "7"}, "3932156": {"ParentId": "3932081", "CommentCount": "7", "Body": "<p>In kernel space yes NULL can be a valid address.
