For instance, <a href=\"http://en.cppreference.com/w/cpp/string/byte/memcpy\" rel=\"nofollow\"><code>memcpy</code></a>'s signature is:</p>\n<pre><code>void* memcpy( void* dest, const void* src, std::size_t count );\n</code></pre>\n<p>The <code>src</code> argument is a pointer to <code>const void</code>, because the memory pointed to by <code>src</code> will not be modified by the function. This let's me pass in a pointer to a <code>const</code> object:</p>\n<pre><code>const POD pod{...};\nPOD new_pod;\nmemcpy(&amp;new_pod, &amp;pod, sizeof(pod)); \n</code></pre>\n", "LastActivityDate": "2016-10-09T17:42:31.293", "CommentCount": "0", "CreationDate": "2016-10-09T17:42:31.293", "ParentId": "39946420", "Score": "1", "OwnerUserId": "2069064"}, "39946580": {"Id": "39946580", "PostTypeId": "2", "Body": "<p>\"cv <code>void</code>\" means <code>void</code> which is optionally <code>const</code>- or <code>volatile</code>-qualified.
