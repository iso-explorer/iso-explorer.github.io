So you're free to name them anything and prefix them with anything as long as the identifier starts with an English alphabet.</p>\n<p>As for the usage of global variables, I would say if you are just beginning to learn C++, use them, get hurt and then realize how they are bad; you'll see why they are always condemned by experienced programmers.

Likewise, a variable declared in an unnamed namespace might be considered non-global. However, both of these kinds of variables shared many of the the bad properties of global variables. For example, they introduce a serialization point when being accessed from multiple threads.</p>\n<p>Thus, I consider actually a wider range of variables to be global, i.e., also <code>static</code> data members in classes and function locale <code>static</code> variables. Each of these also exists just once throughout a a program. Just because these constructs happen to be used for some [anti] design patterns (notable Singleton) doesn't magically bless global variables!</p>\n<p>With respect to prefixing variables names: do <em>not</em> include type prefix into your variable names! In C++ types are already sufficiently checked by the compiler. Including the type tends to result in eventually incorrect names. Specifically with respect to global variables, here is my recommendation for their prefix: whenever you want to use the prefix for a global variable stop whatever you are doing! You are in the process of constructing a problem and you should rather seek to change the design to remove the need for the global variable!</p>\n", "LastActivityDate": "2014-03-29T20:10:10.947"}});
