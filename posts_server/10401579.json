Yes, I know how this works, and yes of course this is the expected result. The reason being, the 'this' pointer is correctly set when method() is called.</p>\n<p>The question, the original question here, is that operator new does not produce the expect result for the child, instead acting like the parent type.  Yet, operator new with assignment in it is inherited without any noise from the compiler.</p>\n<p>I think, the real answer to all of this is that operator new differs from other methods in that it is not passed a phantom first operand of a this pointer.  And how could it as n.m. pointed out above, as the object does not exist yet.  Though the type definition already exist, the means by which the compiler communicates type to child methods in multiple inheritance is through the phantom first operand this pointer that has been set to point to the proper area of the object for the type the method was defined under.  </p>\n<p>If the compiler gave us a this_type in the manner of a this pointer, then operator new could access fields in the allocation it has created simply by casting the void *.  This would be very helpful in many situations.</p>\n<p>But the bottom line question that remains to me is why the compiler does not give an error for the illegal assignment, and then  goes and generates code that yields wrong values for the child, as shown in the original code.  (and Jon, yes, I called new on the child and it assigned count as a parent, no warning, etc. that is fair to say, an unexpected outcome in the eyes of any usual programmer).</p>\n", "LastActivityDate": "2012-05-05T01:07:55.720"}, "10403080": {"ParentId": "10401579", "PostTypeId": "2", "CommentCount": "1", "CreationDate": "2012-05-01T19:26:20.003", "Score": "0", "LastEditorUserId": "5987", "LastEditDate": "2012-05-01T19:32:52.877", "Id": "10403080", "OwnerUserId": "5987", "Body": "<p>It is normal for the offsets to be different between a base class and a derived class, especially when multiple inheritance is involved.
