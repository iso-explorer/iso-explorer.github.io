B and C suspend at a certain point, waiting for A to signal them to continue. Among the thread synchronization facilities provided by standard C++, <code>std::condition_variable</code> seems to best fit in here (though still bad). Since <code>std::condition_variable</code> must be used with a lock, the code for B and C may contain lines like:</p>\n<pre><code>{\n  std::mutex mut;\n  std::unique_lock&lt;std::mutex&gt; lock(mut);\n  cond_var.wait(lock);  // cond_var is a global variable of type std::condition_variable`\n}\n</code></pre>\n<p>Note that <code>mut</code> is used here not for synchronization purposes at all, but just to fit the signature of <code>std::condition_variable::wait</code>. With this observation, I'm thinking that maybe we can do better by implementing a dummy lock class, let's say <code>dummy_lock</code>, and replace <code>std::condition_variable</code> with <code>std::condition_variable_any</code>. <code>dummy_lock</code> meets the <a href=\"http://en.cppreference.com/w/cpp/concept/BasicLockable\" rel=\"nofollow\">BasicLockable</a> requirements with all its methods essentially doing nothing. Thereby, we get code similar to the following:</p>\n<pre><code>{\n  dummy_lock lock;\n  cond_var.wait(lock);  // cond_var is a global variable of type std::condition_variable_any`\n}\n</code></pre>\n<p>This, if works at all, should be of higher efficiency than the original one. But the question is, does it even work <strong>according to the standard (language-lawyers are apt here)</strong>? Even if it works, this is by-no-means an elegant solution.
