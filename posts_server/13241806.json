But that is just speculation in the direction of rationalization. For example, imagine reallocation of the buffer in a vector of such function objects, where an attempt is made to move the originals, and where in the middle somewhere one of them throws (I think this was the original example by Abrahams et.al). Oh dang, they can't guaranteed be moved back, and neither can we go forward. So the reallocation fails, and the operation that caused the reallocation, fails, <em>with the vector in an invalid state</em>. A requirement of non-throwing move of the callable objects would have supported such general usage of function objects, including optimized vector reallocation (etc.). Which IMHO makes it doubtful that the intent really has been to make this trade-off.</p>\n", "Id": "13241886", "OwnerUserId": "464581", "LastEditDate": "2015-05-25T01:24:38.277", "ParentId": "13241806", "LastActivityDate": "2015-05-25T01:24:38.277", "PostTypeId": "2", "Score": "5", "LastEditorUserId": "464581"}, "29099638": {"CreationDate": "2015-03-17T12:55:05.830", "CommentCount": "0", "Body": "<p>None of the other answers really make sense to me.  <code>std::function</code> <em>does</em> have a <code>noexcept</code> default constructor and a <code>noexcept</code> <code>swap</code> method, so an implementor could always define the move constructor like so:</p>\n<pre><code>function(function&amp;&amp; other) noexcept\n  : function()\n{\n  swap(*this, other);\n}\n</code></pre>\n<p>Given the above, I'm not sure why the committee declined to make the move constructor <code>noexcept</code>.
