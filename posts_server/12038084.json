But your implementation should never <em>dereference</em> <code>end</code>, the last entry actually accessed should be <code>end-1</code>, which is guaranteed to be in valid region. If your algorithm dereferences <code>*end</code> then is a bug. In fact there are test allocators that intentionally place the region on the very last bytes of a valid page, immedeatly followed by an unallocated region. With such allocators an algorithm that dereferences <code>*end</code> will cause protection fault.</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p id=\"so_12038084_12038211_0\"><a href=\"http://technet.microsoft.com/en-us/library/cc779664%28v=ws.10%29\" rel=\"nofollow\"><code>FLG_HEAP_PAGE_ALLOCS</code></a></p>\n<p id=\"so_12038084_12038211_1\">Turns on page heap debugging, which verifies dynamic heap memory\n  operations, including allocations and frees, and causes a debugger\n  break when it detects a heap error.</p>\n<p id=\"so_12038084_12038211_2\">This option enables full page heap debugging when set for image files\n  and standard page heap debugging when set in system registry or kernel\n  mode.</p>\n<ul>\n<li><p id=\"so_12038084_12038211_3\">Full page heap debugging (for /i) places an inaccessible page at the\n  end of an allocation.</p></li>\n<li><p id=\"so_12038084_12038211_4\">Standard page heap debugging (for /r or /k) examines allocations as\n  they are freed.</p></li>\n</ul>\n<p id=\"so_12038084_12038211_5\">Setting this flag for an image file is the same as typing gflags /p\n  enable /full for the image file at the command line</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>As for the issue of pointer overfllow: no operating system allocates page containing VA address 0xFFFFFFFF, same way no operating system ever allocates page containing 0x00000000.
