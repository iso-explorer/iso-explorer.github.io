The possibility and usability of this happening in practice and actually being the cause of your problem at that point are negligible.</p>\n<p>If you look at the C++ <code>std::string</code> class, you will notice the <code>static std::string::npos</code> data member is defined as exactly <code>-1</code> converted to <code>std::string::size_type</code> (which is really just <code>std::size_t</code>. That gives this \"technique\" a sense of precedence, which allows it to fullfil The Principle of Least Surprise\u2122, which is always a Good Thing\u00ae.</p>\n<p>Now, using <code>-1</code> directly in a comparison like that is asking for trouble. You should, as in the <code>std::string</code> case, ensure there is an accessible name for this value that will ensure its special meaning. unfortunately, the C++ type system isn't strict enough for this to prevent a user from shooting himself in the foot, but at least a user adhering to documented best practice won't think of doing things differently.</p>\n", "OwnerUserId": "256138", "PostTypeId": "2", "Id": "28500654", "Score": "2", "CreationDate": "2015-02-13T13:24:44.377", "LastActivityDate": "2015-02-13T13:24:44.377"}, "22801338": {"ParentId": "22801069", "CommentCount": "0", "Body": "<p>After trying to think of ways this might go wrong, I realized that there's a danger that the calling function might implicitly cast the return value to a larger type (ie unsigned int to unsigned long long).
