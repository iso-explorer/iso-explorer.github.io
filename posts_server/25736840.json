This is fixed for the objects lifetime (optimisations might mean that the data is sometimes cached in registers or whatever; but the program must behave as if the object is at a fixed memory location throughout its lifetime).</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p id=\"so_25736840_25738746_1\">Does the storage location of original object changed at the line <code>new (&amp;a) B</code>? </p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>No, the location of an object never changes. This creates a new object, of a different type, in the same memory location. In other words, it ends the lifetime of the original object - without calling its destructor - and reuses the memory for a different object.</p>\n<p>The quote is saying that, since the variable has automatic storage duration, the destructor of <code>A</code> will be called when it goes out of scope. This would be a very bad thing to do if there's no longer a valid <code>A</code> object there; hence the rule that you must restore an <code>A</code> before it's destroyed.</p>\n", "OwnerUserId": "204847", "PostTypeId": "2", "Id": "25738746", "Score": "1", "CreationDate": "2014-09-09T07:17:17.477", "LastActivityDate": "2014-09-09T07:17:17.477"}, "bq_ids": {"n4140": {"so_25736840_25738746_1": {"section_id": 7195, "quality": 0.625, "length": 5}, "so_25736840_25736840_0": {"section_id": 7196, "quality": 0.875, "length": 28}}, "n3337": {"so_25736840_25738746_1": {"section_id": 6939, "quality": 0.625, "length": 5}, "so_25736840_25736840_0": {"section_id": 6940, "quality": 0.875, "length": 28}}, "n4659": {"so_25736840_25738746_1": {"section_id": 8704, "quality": 0.625, "length": 5}, "so_25736840_25736840_0": {"section_id": 8705, "quality": 0.875, "length": 28}}}, "25736840": {"CommentCount": "0", "AcceptedAnswerId": "25738746", "PostTypeId": "1", "LastEditorUserId": "2297448", "CreationDate": "2014-09-09T04:42:59.633", "LastActivityDate": "2014-09-09T07:17:17.477", "LastEditDate": "2014-09-09T05:51:54.200", "ViewCount": "139", "FavoriteCount": "1", "Title": "Variable's storage location", "Id": "25736840", "Score": "1", "Body": "<p>What is the variable's \"storage location\"?
