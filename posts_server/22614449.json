It is implementation-defined whether\n  a program in a freestanding environment is required to define a main\n  function. [ Note: In a freestanding environment, start-up and\n  termination is implementation-defined; start- up contains the\n  execution of constructors for objects of namespace scope with static\n  storage duration; termination contains the execution of destructors\n  for objects with static storage duration. \u2014 end note ]</p>\n<p id=\"so_22614449_22614761_2\">An implementation shall not predefine the main function. This function\n  shall not be overloaded. It shall have a return type of type int, but\n  otherwise its type is implementation-defined. All implementations\n  shall allow both of the following definitions of main:</p>\n<p id=\"so_22614449_22614761_3\">int main() { /* ... <em>/ } and int main(int argc, char</em> argv[]) { /* ...\n  */ }</p>\n<p id=\"so_22614449_22614761_4\">In the latter form argc shall be the number of arguments passed to the\n  program from the environ- ment in which the program is run. If argc is\n  nonzero these arguments shall be supplied in argv[0] through\n  argv[argc-1] as pointers to the initial characters of null-terminated\n  multibyte strings (ntmbs s) (17.5.2.1.4.2) and argv[0] shall be the\n  pointer to the initial character of a ntmbs that represents the name\n  used to invoke the program or \"\". The value of argc shall be\n  non-negative. The value of argv[argc] shall be 0. [ Note: It is\n  recommended that any further (optional) parameters be added after\n  argv. \u2014 end note ]</p>\n<p id=\"so_22614449_22614761_5\">The function main shall not be used within a program. The linkage\n  (3.5) of main is implementation-defined. A program that defines main\n  as deleted or that declares main to be inline, static, or constexpr is\n  ill- formed. The name main is not otherwise reserved. [ Example:\n  member functions, classes, and enumerations can be called main, as can\n  entities in other namespaces. \u2014 end example ]</p>\n<p id=\"so_22614449_22614761_6\">Terminating the program without leaving the current block (e.g., by\n  calling the function std::exit(int) (18.5)) does not destroy any\n  objects with automatic storage duration (12.4). If std::exit is called\n  to end a program during the destruction of an object with static or\n  thread storage duration, the program has undefined behavior.</p>\n<p id=\"so_22614449_22614761_7\">A return statement in main has the effect of leaving the main function\n  (destroying any objects with automatic storage duration) and calling\n  std::exit with the return value as the argument. If control reaches\n  the end of main without encountering a return statement, the effect is\n  that of executing return 0;</p>\n</blockquote>\n", "LastActivityDate": "2014-03-24T16:12:25.177", "CommentCount": "0", "CreationDate": "2014-03-24T16:12:25.177", "ParentId": "22614449", "Score": "0", "OwnerUserId": "2249683"}, "22614449": {"ViewCount": "2121", "Body": "<p>I do know about the main() method used in C/C++ &amp; Java but since the main() is user defined (as the code inside the main() is defined by the user, it can't be a predefined method) &amp; in C/C++ the main is not stored in a header file, then where is it exactly located so that the compiler first searches for it in a program?
