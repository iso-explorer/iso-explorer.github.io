This pattern is called the <em>usual arithmetic conversions</em>, which are defined as follows:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>If either operand is of type <code>long double</code>, the other shall be converted to <code>long double</code>.</li>\n<li>Otherwise, if either operand is <code>double</code>, the other shall be converted to <code>double</code>.</li>\n<li>Otherwise, if either operand is <code>float</code>, the other shall be converted to <code>float</code>.</li>\n<li>Otherwise, the integral promotions (4.5) shall be performed on both operands.</li>\n<li>Then, if either operand is <code>unsigned long</code> the other shall be converted to <code>unsigned long</code>.</li>\n<li>Otherwise, if one operand is a <code>long int</code> and the other <code>unsigned int</code>, then if a <code>long int</code> can represent all the values of an <code>unsigned int</code>, the <code>unsigned int</code> shall be converted to a <code>long int</code>; otherwise both operands shall be converted to <code>unsigned long int</code>.</li>\n<li>Otherwise, if either operand is <code>long</code>, the other shall be converted to <code>long</code>.</li>\n<li>Otherwise, if either operand is <code>unsigned</code>, the other shall be converted to <code>unsigned</code>.</li>\n</ul>\n<p id=\"so_5780578_5780629_1\">[<em>Note:</em> otherwise, the only remaining case is that both operands are <code>int</code>]</p>\n</blockquote>\n", "LastActivityDate": "2011-04-25T16:42:25.543", "CommentCount": "0", "CreationDate": "2011-04-25T16:42:25.543", "ParentId": "5780578", "Score": "8", "OwnerUserId": "636019"}, "5780609": {"Id": "5780609", "PostTypeId": "2", "Body": "<p>You are correct in all cases.
