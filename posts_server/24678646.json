I could imagine that if the class is huge data-wise, but the constructor and destructor (and anybody else) do not access that data, the compiler could just call the constructor and destructor in the proper order, without leaving space for the unused data.</p>\n<hr>\n<p>As for your example, you're <em>declaring</em> <code>Y::m</code>, but you never <em>define</em> it.
