So we can use most of the C functions/headers in C++ by changing the name a little bit (<code>stdio.h</code> to <code>cstdio</code>, <code>stdlib.h</code> to <code>cstdlib</code>). </p>\n<p>My question is actually kind of semantic. In C++ code (using newest version of GCC compiler), I can call <code>printf(\"Hello world!);</code> and <code>std::printf(\"Hello world!);</code> and it works exactly the same.
