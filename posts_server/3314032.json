This can make it practical to achieve some effects that could not be practically achieved via any other means.</p>\n<p>As a simple example, on many embedded systems pointer indirection is very expensive compared to direct variable access.  Code which uses a lot of pointer indirection may very well be twice as large and slow as code which simply uses variables.  Consequently, if a particular routine is used with two sets of variables, in a scenario where one would usually pass in a pointer to a structure and then use the arrow operator, it may be far more efficient to simple put the routine in its own file (I normally use extension .i) which is #included once without macro _PASS2 defined, and a second time with.  That file can then #ifdef _PASS2/#else to define macros for all the variables that should be different on the two passes.  Even though the code gets generated twice, on some micros that will take less space than using the arrow operator with passed-in pointers.</p>\n", "LastActivityDate": "2010-07-23T14:39:05.823", "Score": "3", "CreationDate": "2010-07-23T14:39:05.823", "ParentId": "3314032", "CommentCount": "0", "OwnerUserId": "363751"}, "bq_ids": {"n4140": {"so_3314032_3315074_0": {"length": 12, "quality": 0.8, "section_id": 532}}, "n3337": {"so_3314032_3315074_0": {"length": 12, "quality": 0.8, "section_id": 523}}, "n4659": {"so_3314032_3315074_0": {"length": 12, "quality": 0.8, "section_id": 553}}}, "3314056": {"Id": "3314056", "PostTypeId": "2", "Body": "<p>No.  Even if a macro expands into something that looks like a preprocessing directive, the expansion is not evaluated as a preprocessing directive.</p>\n", "LastActivityDate": "2010-07-22T22:36:19.190", "Score": "12", "CreationDate": "2010-07-22T22:36:19.190", "ParentId": "3314032", "CommentCount": "0", "OwnerUserId": "151292"}, "3314073": {"Id": "3314073", "PostTypeId": "2", "Body": "<p>No. The pre-processor is single-pass.
