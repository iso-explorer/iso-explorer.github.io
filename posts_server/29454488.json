However, in the interests of backwards compatibility and allowing the easiest possible transition the 'modularizations' of the standard library I've used happen to explicitly allow code that previously depended on indirect includes to continue to work.</p>\n<p>You can see this, for example, in libc++'s <a href=\"http://llvm.org/svn/llvm-project/libcxx/trunk/include/module.modulemap\" rel=\"nofollow\">module map</a>; Those <code>export *</code> lines declare \"any modules imported by this module are also exported.\" Which is to say, a module std.algorithm that imports a module std.cmath also exports, so anyone that imports std.algorithm also gets access to std.cmath.</p>\n<p>For new code it would be very nice if these 'legacy exports' could be turned off, but for pre-existing large projects it is very nice to be able to just flip on -fmodules and have the project work with no changes.</p>\n<hr>\n<p>Using clang's implementation of modules with libc++, and modifying the module map file to remove the non-portable, indirect include behavior, clang reports such errors like:</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p id=\"so_29454488_29461049_1\">main.cpp:5:16: error: declaration of 'log' must be imported from module 'Darwin.C.math' before it is required</p>\n<pre><code>return int(log(23.f));\n           ^  \n</code></pre>\n<p id=\"so_29454488_29461049_2\">/usr/include/math.h:387:15: note: previous declaration is here  </p>\n<pre><code>extern double log(double);  \n              ^  \n</code></pre>\n<p id=\"so_29454488_29461049_3\">1 error generated.</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>libc++ <code>&lt;algorithm&gt;</code> doesn't include <code>&lt;cmath&gt;</code>, so I used <code>&lt;random&gt;</code> instead.
