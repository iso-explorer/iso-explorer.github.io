Why could it not, for example, call an implementation in a derived class?</p>\n<p>Well, if it could, then code in the derived class could be executed before the derived class instance was initialized, which means that it could be executed with faulty assumptions about instance variable values, which means it could easily lead to bugs.</p>\n<p>And that's the situation in e.g. Java and C#.</p>\n<p>In C++, however, execution of code in a constructor or destructor of a class <code>T</code> is performed with the <code>*this</code> object of <strong>dynamic type</strong> <code>T</code>. Calls to virtual functions here have the same effect <em>as if</em> the object was originally instantiated as <code>T</code> (even if <code>T</code> has pure virtual functions). This ensures that the effect of the code is independent of what may be done in derived classes, that you as the <code>T</code> programmer really know what you have at hand.</p>\n<p>And with these more type safe rules there can't be any derived class implementation of the pure virtual function, because in this context there is no derived class part of the object: it's purely a <code>T</code> object.</p>\n</hr>", "OwnerUserId": "464581", "LastEditorUserId": "464581", "LastEditDate": "2014-04-09T00:45:02.567", "Id": "22950739", "Score": "0", "CreationDate": "2014-04-09T00:34:18.600", "LastActivityDate": "2014-04-09T00:45:02.567"}, "bq_ids": {"n4140": {"so_22950500_22950739_0": {"section_id": 7023, "quality": 0.9444444444444444, "length": 17}, "so_22950500_22950739_1": {"section_id": 5768, "quality": 1.0, "length": 20}}, "n3337": {"so_22950500_22950739_0": {"section_id": 6769, "quality": 0.9444444444444444, "length": 17}, "so_22950500_22950739_1": {"section_id": 5541, "quality": 1.0, "length": 20}}, "n4659": {"so_22950500_22950739_0": {"section_id": 8520, "quality": 0.9444444444444444, "length": 17}, "so_22950500_22950739_1": {"section_id": 7225, "quality": 1.0, "length": 20}}}, "22950500": {"CommentCount": "3", "ViewCount": "78", "PostTypeId": "1", "ClosedDate": "2014-04-09T03:16:15.830", "LastEditorUserId": "241631", "CreationDate": "2014-04-09T00:05:42.577", "LastActivityDate": "2014-04-09T02:15:53.590", "Title": "2 Calling pure virtual function in constructor gives an error?", "LastEditDate": "2014-04-09T00:16:02.627", "Id": "22950500", "Score": "-2", "Body": "<pre><code>class A{\npublic:\nA(){\nthis-&gt;draw();\n}\n  virtual void draw()=0;\n};\n</code></pre>\n<p>Does it cause compile error.
