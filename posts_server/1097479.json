Since both time you call it with a fundamental type, you will <em>not</em> get name lookup at the instantiation context for the function call. </p>\n<p>Name lookup at instantiation context only happens for argument dependent lookup (called <em>lookup using associated namespaces</em>). Both of <code>int</code> and <code>char</code> do not have argument dependent lookup, an thus <em>all</em> the function calls you do will call <code>f(char)</code> after you removed the <code>d++</code> line. </p>\n<hr>\n<p>Since i understand you won't possibly just believe me, here is the Standard quote, out of <code>14.6.4.2</code>:</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p id=\"so_1097479_1098357_1\">For a function call that depends on a template parameter, if the function name is an unqualified-id but not a template-id, the candidate functions are found using the usual lookup rules (3.4.1, 3.4.2) except that:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>For the part of the lookup using unqualified name lookup (3.4.1), only function declarations with external linkage from the template definition context are found.</li>\n<li>For the part of the lookup using associated namespaces (3.4.2), only function declarations with external linkage found in either the template definition context or the template instantiation context are found.</li>\n</ul>\n</blockquote>\n<p>Note that the article uses a defective example of the Standard (at <code>14.6/9</code>) (and note that examples are non-normative: They can't change or state rules. Their purpose entirely is illustrative). The defect has been fixed and is incorporated into the upcoming Standard.
