For example, I could ship my type in a library and derive from it in an entirely new program. How is the library compiler supposed to know that derived might have a different access specifier? The derived type didn't exist when the library was compiled.</p>\n<p>In order to support this, the compiler would have to know access specifiers at runtime and throw an exception if you attempted to access a private member.</p>\n", "OwnerUserId": "298661", "PostTypeId": "2", "Id": "3611101", "Score": "5", "CreationDate": "2010-08-31T16:28:12.443", "LastActivityDate": "2010-08-31T16:28:12.443"}, "5961950": {"ParentId": "3610936", "CommentCount": "1", "Body": "<p>Access modifiers, such as <code>public</code>, <code>private</code> and <code>protected</code> are only enforced during compilation.
