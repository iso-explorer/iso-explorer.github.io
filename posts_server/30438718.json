I realize that this is rather obtuse, given that I could workaround the issue in several ways. However, given the quote, is this a violation of the standard which is generally permitted, or is somehow otherwise explicitly allowed?</p>\n", "Tags": "<c++><language-lawyer>", "OwnerUserId": "3493731", "AnswerCount": "1"}, "bq_ids": {"n4140": {"so_30438718_30438718_0": {"section_id": 5770, "quality": 0.9285714285714286, "length": 13}}, "n3337": {"so_30438718_30438718_0": {"section_id": 5543, "quality": 0.9285714285714286, "length": 13}}, "n4659": {"so_30438718_30438718_0": {"section_id": 7227, "quality": 0.9285714285714286, "length": 13}}}});
