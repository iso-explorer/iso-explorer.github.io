This has nothing to do with poor support\u2026 just be sure to open up the file in binary mode, as you must with any library providing such functionality.</p>\n", "LastEditorUserId": "153285", "LastActivityDate": "2011-04-14T18:49:09.417", "Score": "3", "CreationDate": "2011-04-14T18:28:14.087", "ParentId": "5666899", "CommentCount": "5", "OwnerUserId": "153285", "LastEditDate": "2011-04-14T18:49:09.417"}, "5666944": {"Id": "5666944", "PostTypeId": "2", "Body": "<p>The first paragraph you cited tells you: it's not that Unicode streams in particular are more difficult than other streams, it's that iostreams in general are extremely complicated.
