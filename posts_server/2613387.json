Otherwise, base class pointer adjustments may destroy the value of the pointer.</p>\n<p>In practice, this is (probably) only relevant when using multiple inheritance: pointers to a derived class may differ in their physical address from pointers to their base class.</p>\n", "OwnerUserId": "1968", "PostTypeId": "2", "Id": "2613389", "Score": "7", "CreationDate": "2010-04-10T12:42:35.650", "LastActivityDate": "2010-04-10T12:42:35.650"}, "2613387": {"CommentCount": "0", "CreationDate": "2010-04-10T12:40:25.837", "PostTypeId": "1", "AcceptedAnswerId": "2613393", "LastEditorUserId": "1977903", "LastActivityDate": "2012-09-19T03:02:32.637", "LastEditDate": "2010-04-10T12:44:14.863", "ViewCount": "4121", "FavoriteCount": "1", "Title": "Casting pointer to object to void * in C++", "Id": "2613387", "Score": "12", "Body": "<p>I've been reading StackOverflow too much and started doubting all the code I've ever written, I keep thinking \"Is that undefined behavour?\" even in code that has been working for ages.</p>\n<p>So my question - Is it safe and well defined behavour to cast a pointer to an object (In this case abstract interface classes) to a void* and then later on cast them back to the original class and call method using them?</p>\n<p>I'm fully aware that the code that does this is probably awful. I wouldn't even consider writing it like this now (this is old code which I don't really want to change), so I'm not looking for a discussion of better ways to do this. I already know how to write it better if I ever did this again. But if it's actually broken to rely on this in C++ then I'll have to look at changing the code, if it's merely awful code then changing it won't be a priority.</p>\n<p>I would have had no doubts about something this simple a year or two ago but as my understanding of C++ increases I actually find I have more and more worries about code being safe under the standards even if it works perfectly well.
