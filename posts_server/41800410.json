I have a pointer to the most derived class, and typecasted (implicit) to middle any class, while deleting, i thought it should be able to delete the allocated space by the first new. In some compilers, it seem fine, but in linux gcc version 4.7.2 (Debian 4.7.2-5), it is giving segmentation fault. Not able to figure out, why? Any help/pointer/suggestion will be appreciated.</p>\n<p>Note - Class is derived in the form of diamond problem.</p>\n", "AcceptedAnswerId": "41800482", "Title": "segmentation fault for deleting a pointer", "CreationDate": "2017-01-23T06:28:58.150", "Id": "41800410", "CommentCount": "3", "LastEditDate": "2017-01-23T10:35:52.557", "PostTypeId": "1", "LastEditorUserId": "6764663", "LastActivityDate": "2017-01-23T10:35:52.557", "Score": "3", "OwnerUserId": "1080000", "Tags": "<c++><pointers><segmentation-fault><language-lawyer><delete-operator>", "AnswerCount": "3"}, "41800569": {"Id": "41800569", "PostTypeId": "2", "Body": "<p>To add to the previous answer, the <code>undefined</code> behaviour comes from the fact that casting the pointer to a base class means (most of the time, but not in your example) <em>slicing</em>: the pointer is adjusted (i.e. incremented) to point to the beginning of the embedded class.</p>\n<p>So upon calling <code>delete</code> on the incremented pointer, you risk freeing part of memory and let some of it <em>dangling</em>.</p>\n", "LastActivityDate": "2017-01-23T06:41:51.320", "CommentCount": "0", "CreationDate": "2017-01-23T06:41:51.320", "ParentId": "41800410", "Score": "1", "OwnerUserId": "2667536"}, "41800528": {"Id": "41800528", "PostTypeId": "2", "Body": "<p>Attempting to delete a pointer that was not returned by <code>new</code>.
