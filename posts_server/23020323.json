For undated references, the latest edition of the\n  referenced document (including any amendments) applies.</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>but there are no guidelines on how to apply the references. The easy cases are when the C++11 explicitly refers back to a reference, for example in section <code>3.9.1</code> <em>Fundamental types</em> it says:</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p id=\"so_23020323_23020323_1\">[...]The signed and unsigned integer types shall satisfy the\n  constraints given in the C standard, section 5.2.4.2.1.</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>But what about other cases where there is no explicit reference? For example, C++11 uses the word <em>indeterminate value</em> but it does not define the term. The normative references include:</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p id=\"so_23020323_23020323_2\">\u2014 ISO/IEC 9899:1999, Programming languages \u2014 C</p>\n<p id=\"so_23020323_23020323_3\">[...]</p>\n<p id=\"so_23020323_23020323_4\">\u2014 ISO/IEC 9899:1999/Cor.3:2007(E), Programming languages \u2014 C, Technical Corrigendum 3</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>and C99(<em><a href=\"http://www.open-std.org/jtc1/sc22/wg14/www/docs/n1256.pdf\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">draft c99 standard</a></em>) does have a definition for <em>indeterminate value</em> in section <code>3.17.2</code> which says:</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p id=\"so_23020323_23020323_5\">either an unspecified value or a trap representation</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>Is it correct to say that <em>indeterminate value</em> is defined C++11 by reference to C99, like <a href=\"https://stackoverflow.com/a/12655876/1708801\">this answer seems to do for the definition of bit</a>? If yes, what about <em>trap representation</em> which is covered in in section <code>6.2.6.1</code> paragraph <em>5</em> under <em>Representations of types</em> in C99? </p>\n<p>The generous reading would be that as long as nothing in the C++11 conflicts with a normative reference then it applies, is this the correct interpretation? Some of the answers to <a href=\"https://stackoverflow.com/questions/11240484/what-is-indeterminate-behavior-in-c-how-is-it-different-from-undefined-behav\">What is indeterminate behavior in C++ ? How is it different from undefined behavior?</a> seem to imply a generous reading, although the language is a bit loose in some of the answers, so it is hard to tell what exactly is being claimed on some points.</p>\n", "Tags": "<c++><c++11><standards><language-lawyer><iso>", "OwnerUserId": "1708801", "AnswerCount": "1"}, "23021390": {"ParentId": "23020323", "CommentCount": "5", "Body": "<p>The function of the <em>Normative References</em> section of an ISO standard document is defined in <a href=\"http://www.iec.ch/members_experts/refdocs/iec/isoiec-dir2%7Bed6.0%7Den.pdf\">ISO/IEC Directives, Part 2, 2011</a> \u00a76.2.2:</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p id=\"so_23020323_23021390_0\"><strong>6.2.2 Normative references</strong></p>\n<p id=\"so_23020323_23021390_1\">This conditional element shall give a list of the referenced documents cited (see 6.6.7.5) in \n  the document in such a way as to make them indispensable for the application of the document.
