Additionally in c++11 there is keyword override wich checks if implemented method in inheriting class overrodes virtual method of base class. In case of implemented function there is no much difference. We can sam that in case of virtual we talk avout override in other case about hiding of base method ( in both cases your cab still invoke implementation of base). Additionally this is information for programmer that function is intended to override. Additionaly virtual keyword is important in case of destructor. As general rule of thumb if function has some virtual methods it is good to have it a virtual destructor.</p>\n", "LastEditorUserId": "5064707", "LastActivityDate": "2015-07-11T08:28:29.037", "Score": "0", "CreationDate": "2015-07-11T08:06:22.450", "ParentId": "31354825", "CommentCount": "0", "OwnerUserId": "5064707", "LastEditDate": "2015-07-11T08:28:29.037"}, "31354856": {"Id": "31354856", "PostTypeId": "2", "Body": "<p>Yes, they are the same.
