The C++ standards define the syntax of the language and implementation requirements.  You are using the STL which is a powerful library, but like all libraries it is not part of C++ itself...although I guess it could be argued that when used aggressively, libraries like STL and Qt extend the language into a different superset language.</p>\n<p>Invalid pointers are perfectly compliant with the C++ standards, the computer just won't like it when you dereference them.</p>\n<p>What you are asking is more of a best practices question.  If your code is multi-threaded and <code>intList</code> is potentially shared, then your first approach may be  more dangerous, but as Greg suggested if you know that <code>intList</code> can't be accessed then the first approach may be more efficient.  That said, I believe safety should usually win in a trade-off until you know there is a performance problem.</p>\n<p>As suggested by the Design by Contract concept, all code defines a contract whether implicit or explicit.  The real issue with code like this is what are you promising the user: preconditions, postconditions, invariants, etc.  The libraries make a certain contract and each function you write defines its own contract.  You just need to pick the appropriate balance for you code, and as long as you make it clear to the user (or yourself six months from now) what is safe and what isn't, it will be okay.</p>\n<p>If there are best practices documented with with an API, then use them whenever possible.  They probably are best practices for a reason.
