The reason it doesn't allow <code>void</code> for your <code>main</code> function is because the main function needs to return success or failure to the operating system.  Convention is that returning 0 means the program executed successfully and any other number is an error code.</p>\n<p>You can optionally add the <code>argc</code> and <code>argv</code> parameters to your main function, which are used to get values passed to your program from the command line.  For example if your program is called \"myprogram\" then if you executed it from the command line using the following command:</p>\n<pre><code>./myprogram -test\n</code></pre>\n<p>then <code>argc</code>, which is the length of the array argv, would be 2, and argv would be an array with the following values:</p>\n<pre><code>argv[0] = \"./myprogram\";\nargv[1] = \"-test\";\n</code></pre>\n", "LastActivityDate": "2012-07-06T13:31:31.707"}, "11355557": {"ParentId": "11355513", "CommentCount": "0", "Body": "<p>There are only two ways the C++ standard specifies as maximally portable ways to declare <code>main</code>.
