Doing this makes sense in that the void* parameter takes the place of template functions in this ANSI-C library. All you need is a true/false value. So, there should be no danger in temporarily encoding this as a pointer as long as it is well documented as such.

For example, it aids in porting to 64-bit platforms. </p>\n<p>Casting a 64-bit pointer into an integral type that is smaller than a pointer (such as <code>int</code> or <code>bool</code>) is often a bug: you're truncating the pointer's value. Furthermore, the C++ specification doesn't seem to guarantee that you can directly cast a pointer into a smaller integral type (emphasis added):</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p id=\"so_606728_609661_0\">5.2.10.4. A pointer can be explicitly converted to any integral type <em>large enough to hold it</em>.

Unless you're writing low-level platform-specific code for memory mapped I/O access or DMA, you usually don't want to be doing this at all, unless you're doing something hacky (like stuffing a Boolean into a pointer). But the C++ specification doesn't seem to say much about this case other than that it is implementation-defined (footnote omitted):</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p id=\"so_606728_609661_1\">5.2.10.5.

If the origin of the error was the mismatch between the integral type's size and the pointer size, then this will work on most 32-bit platforms (where both <code>int</code> and <code>void*</code> are 32 bits) but fail on most 64-bit platforms (where <code>int</code> is 32 bits and <code>void*</code> is 64 bits). In that case, replacing <code>int</code> in this expression with a pointer-sized integer type such as <code>uintptr_t</code> or <code>DWORD_PTR</code> (on Windows) should work, since conversions between <code>bool</code> and pointer-sized integers are allowed, and so are conversions between pointer-sized integers and pointers.</p>\n<p>Later versions of GCC have the following <a href=\"http://gcc.gnu.org/onlinedocs/gcc-4.3.3/gcc/Warning-Options.html\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">warning suppression options</a>, but <a href=\"http://osdir.com/ml/solaris.opensolaris.tools.general/2006-08/msg00014.html\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">not for C++</a>:</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p id=\"so_606728_609661_3\">-Wno-int-to-pointer-cast (C and Objective-C only)<br>\n  Suppress warnings from casts to pointer type of an integer of a different size.</br></p>\n<p id=\"so_606728_609661_4\">-Wno-pointer-to-int-cast (C and Objective-C only)<br>\n  Suppress warnings from casts from a pointer to an integer type of a different size.</br></p>\n</blockquote>\n", "OwnerDisplayName": "bk1e", "LastActivityDate": "2009-03-04T08:08:36.867", "Score": "0", "CreationDate": "2009-03-04T08:08:36.867", "ParentId": "606728", "CommentCount": "0", "OwnerUserId": "8090"}, "606832": {"Id": "606832", "PostTypeId": "2", "Body": "<p>It looks like it should work, according to the standard.
