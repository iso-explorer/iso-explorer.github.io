But you shouldn't use this as \"this is how to execute code at <em>global scope.\"</em> Use is as what it's intended for: \"this is how to initialise a global variable.\"</p>\n<p>If you need code to run at program start, put it at the beginning of <code>main</code>. It is quite rare you'd need code to run <em>before</em> that on its own, without caring for its return value. If you do find yourself in such a situation, faking initialisation is a possible workaround. But remember the caveats, such as the generally unspecified order of such before-<code>main</code> code execution.</p>\n", "LastActivityDate": "2015-05-03T14:50:54.313", "CommentCount": "2", "CreationDate": "2015-05-03T14:50:54.313", "ParentId": "30015149", "Score": "2", "OwnerUserId": "1782465"}, "bq_ids": {"n4140": {"so_30015149_30015191_0": {"length": 12, "quality": 0.9230769230769231, "section_id": 7134}}, "n3337": {"so_30015149_30015191_0": {"length": 12, "quality": 0.9230769230769231, "section_id": 6878}}, "n4659": {"so_30015149_30015191_0": {"length": 11, "quality": 0.8461538461538461, "section_id": 8635}}}, "30015149": {"ViewCount": "94", "Body": "<p>I found a peculiar thing: static member functions of a class/struct cannot be called a global scope, unless they have a return value.</p>\n<p>This program does not compile:</p>\n<pre><code>struct test\n{\n  static void dostuff()\n  {\n      std::cout &lt;&lt; \"dostuff was called.\" &lt;&lt; std::endl;\n  }\n};\n\ntest::dostuff();\n\nint main()\n{  \n   return 0;\n}\n</code></pre>\n<p>Giving us the following under GCC v4.8.3:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"so_30015149_30015149_0\">\n<pre><code>main.cpp:12:16: error: expected constructor, destructor, or type conversion before ';' token\ntest::dostuff();\n               ^\n</code></pre>\n</blockquote>\n<p>However, by adding a return value to <code>dostuff()</code> and assigning it to a global variable, the program compiles and works as intended:</p>\n<pre><code>struct test\n{\n  static int dostuff()\n  {\n      std::cout &lt;&lt; \"dostuff was called.\" &lt;&lt; std::endl;\n      return 0;\n  }\n};\n\nint i = test::dostuff();\n\nint main()\n{\n   return 0;\n}\n</code></pre>\n<p>This yields the expected output:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"so_30015149_30015149_1\">\n<pre><code>dostuff was called.\n</code></pre>\n</blockquote>\n<p>Can anyone explain to me why this is the case and if there is a work-around that doesn't involve creating global variables?</p>\n", "AcceptedAnswerId": "30015191", "Title": "Why can static member functions only be called at global scope if they have a return value?", "CreationDate": "2015-05-03T14:43:55.010", "Id": "30015149", "CommentCount": "3", "LastEditDate": "2015-05-03T14:50:48.710", "PostTypeId": "1", "LastEditorUserId": "2069064", "LastActivityDate": "2015-05-03T14:50:54.313", "Score": "4", "OwnerUserId": "1514515", "Tags": "<c++><static><member-functions>", "AnswerCount": "2"}, "30015191": {"Id": "30015191", "PostTypeId": "2", "Body": "<p>You cannot call functions at global scope because, from [basic.link]</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p id=\"so_30015149_30015191_0\">A <em>program</em> consists of one or more <em>translation units</em> (Clause 2) linked together.
