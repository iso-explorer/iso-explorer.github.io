Note:\n  you should make your base classes\n  explicitly public, private, or\n  protected, rather than relying on the\n  defaults.</p>\n<p id=\"so_92859_92951_2\">Struct and class are otherwise\n  functionally equivalent.</p>\n<p id=\"so_92859_92951_3\">OK, enough of that squeaky clean\n  techno talk.  Emotionally, most\n  developers make a strong distinction\n  between a class and a struct.  A\n  struct simply feels like an open pile\n  of bits with very little in the way of\n  encapsulation or functionality.  A\n  class feels like a living and\n  responsible member of society with\n  intelligent services, a strong\n  encapsulation barrier, and a well\n  defined interface.  Since that's the\n  connotation most people already have,\n  you should probably use the struct\n  keyword if you have a class that has\n  very few methods and has public data\n  (such things do exist in well designed\n  systems!), but otherwise you should\n  probably use the class keyword.</p>\n</blockquote>\n", "OwnerUserId": "8747"}, "29986884": {"ParentId": "92859", "CommentCount": "1", "Body": "<p>You might consider this for guidelines on when to go for struct or class, <a href=\"https://msdn.microsoft.com/en-us/library/ms229017%28v=vs.110%29.aspx\" rel=\"nofollow\">https://msdn.microsoft.com/en-us/library/ms229017%28v=vs.110%29.aspx</a> .</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p id=\"so_92859_29986884_0\">\u221a CONSIDER defining a struct instead of a class if instances of the\n  type are small and commonly short-lived or are commonly embedded in\n  other objects. </p>\n<p id=\"so_92859_29986884_1\">X AVOID defining a struct unless the type has all of\n  the following characteristics: </p>\n<p id=\"so_92859_29986884_2\">It logically represents a single value,\n  similar to primitive types (int, double, etc.). </p>\n<p id=\"so_92859_29986884_3\">It has an instance\n  size under 16 bytes. </p>\n<p id=\"so_92859_29986884_4\">It is immutable. </p>\n<p id=\"so_92859_29986884_5\">It will not have to be boxed\n  frequently.</p>\n</blockquote>\n", "OwnerUserId": "1141493", "PostTypeId": "2", "Id": "29986884", "Score": "-1", "CreationDate": "2015-05-01T12:30:43.610", "LastActivityDate": "2015-05-01T12:30:43.610"}, "92941": {"ParentId": "92859", "CommentCount": "0", "Body": "<p>It's just a convention.

Structs are particularly useful in file serialization/deserialization as the structure can often be written to the file verbatim. (i.e. Obtain a pointer to the struct, use the SIZE macro to compute the number of bytes to copy, then move the data in or out of the struct.)</p>\n<p>Classes are a different type of abstract data type that attempt to ensure information hiding. Internally, there can be a variety of machinations, methods, temp variables, state variables. etc. that are all used to present a consistent API to any code which wishes to use the class. </p>\n<p>In effect, structs are about data, classes are about code.</p>\n<p>However, you do need to understand that these are merely abstractions. It's perfectly possible to create structs that look a lot like classes and classes that look a lot like structs. In fact, the earliest C++ compilers were merely pre-compilers that translates C++ code to C. Thus these abstractions are a benefit to logical thinking, not necessarily an asset to the computer itself.</p>\n<p>Beyond the fact that each is a different type of abstraction, Classes provide solutions to the C code naming puzzle. Since you can't have more than one function exposed with the same name, developers used to follow a pattern of _(). e.g. mathlibextreme_max(). By grouping APIs into classes, similar functions (here we call them \"methods\") can be grouped together and protected from the naming of methods in other classes.
