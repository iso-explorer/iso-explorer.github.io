That will result in undefined behavior, except if you have implemented a copy constructor that handles that specific case, for example:</p>\n<pre><code>class Foo\n{\n    public:\n        Foo()\n        {\n            std::cout &lt;&lt; \"Foo()\";\n        }\n\n        Foo(const Foo&amp; from)\n        {\n            if(this == &amp;from) std::cout &lt;&lt; \"special case\";\n            else std::cout &lt;&lt; \"other case\"; \n        }\n};\n</code></pre>\n<p>But that special case is normally used for other purposes, like cheap copies of strings (when using a string class). So don't try and exploit that special case ;)</p>\n", "OwnerUserId": "245706", "PostTypeId": "2", "Id": "2329041", "Score": "5", "CreationDate": "2010-02-24T19:58:42.930", "LastActivityDate": "2010-02-24T19:58:42.930"}, "2328970": {"ParentId": "2328960", "LastEditDate": "2010-02-24T20:47:45.543", "CommentCount": "19", "CreationDate": "2010-02-24T19:47:35.290", "OwnerUserId": "87234", "LastEditorUserId": "87234", "PostTypeId": "2", "Id": "2328970", "Score": "12", "Body": "<p><code>foo</code> is fully initialized once you've entered the body of the constructor (that's the guaranteed general case; specifically once it has finished initializing in the initialize list.)</p>\n<p>In your case, you are copy-constructing from a non-constructed object.

While I think we all agree it would be nice, it simply isn't something the compiler implementers need to worry about.</p>\n<hr>\n<p>Charles points out a loophole of sorts. If <code>Bar</code> has static storage and if <code>Foo</code> is a POD type, then it <em>will</em> be initialized when this code runs. Static-stored variables are zero-initialized before an other initialization runs.</p>\n<p>This means whatever <code>Foo</code> is, as long as it doesn't need a constructor to be run to be initialized (i.e., be POD) it's members will be zero-initialized. Essentially, you'll be copying a zero-initialized object.</p>\n<p>In general though, such code is to be avoided. :)</p>\n</hr>", "LastActivityDate": "2010-02-24T20:47:45.543"}, "2328977": {"ParentId": "2328960", "CommentCount": "0", "Body": "<p>Isn't Foo using a default intrinsic constructor, with the initialisation list invoking that default constructor automatically to initialise the object?</p>\n", "OwnerUserId": "87197", "PostTypeId": "2", "Id": "2328977", "Score": "0", "CreationDate": "2010-02-24T19:48:55.813", "LastActivityDate": "2010-02-24T19:48:55.813"}, "2328960": {"CommentCount": "6", "ViewCount": "321", "PostTypeId": "1", "LastEditorUserId": "87234", "CreationDate": "2010-02-24T19:45:13.830", "LastActivityDate": "2010-02-24T20:47:45.543", "Title": "C++ constructors fun - constructing Foo with a copy of itself", "AcceptedAnswerId": "2328970", "LastEditDate": "2010-02-24T20:26:37.833", "Id": "2328960", "Score": "8", "Body": "<p>I have:</p>\n<pre><code>class Foo;\n\nclass Bar {\n  Foo foo;\n  Bar(): foo(foo) {};\n}\n\nBar bar;\n</code></pre>\n<p>At this point, is</p>\n<pre><code>bar.foo // &lt;--- how is this initialized?\n</code></pre>\n<p>[This question arose from a buggy ref-counted pointer implemntation; I could have sworn that I ensured each pointer was pointing at something non-null; but I ended up with a pointer that pointed at something NULL.]</p>\n", "Tags": "<c++><constructor>", "OwnerUserId": "247265", "AnswerCount": "4"}, "2328996": {"ParentId": "2328960", "LastEditDate": "2010-02-24T19:57:36.707", "CommentCount": "2", "CreationDate": "2010-02-24T19:52:11.633", "OwnerUserId": "229044", "LastEditorUserId": "229044", "PostTypeId": "2", "Id": "2328996", "Score": "3", "Body": "<p>A slightly expanded version of your code seems to indicate that no, <code>foo</code> is never initialized; you would seem to have undefined behavior.
