There's more difference than the path separator. Firstly, the forward slash version doesn't refer to parent path (<code>../</code>), secondly the path is enclosed in <code>&lt; &gt;</code> which is wrong in this case since it appears that the path is intended to be relative to the current file.

To avoid doing double-backslashes every time you want to have only one type of backslash, and because it acts the same way, you can apply the same ability to specify a path separation between folders if you simply use <code>/</code>.  This simplicity cuts down on confusion to someone that doesn't understand escaping, so that they do not take an escaped path literally and put it into an Explorer address bar and get confused when it does not take them to the right place.  </p>\n<p>Note that if it requires <code>&lt;...&gt;</code> tags, you are specifying a system file, while the <code>\"...\"</code> statement was to include a locally-generated one.
