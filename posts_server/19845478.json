Firstly any other translation unit that includes the header containing the class definition preceeded by the static function declaration will fail to compile due to the error that the statically declared friend function is not defined in the referencing translation module. And secondly, the referencing TU can eliminate that compile error by defining the statically declared function itself, and that definition will be able to access all the private data of the class that the function was declared a friend of. This suggests that friend functions should always be left having the public linkage that is their default, as this prevents this potential encapsulation breach due to multiple definitions of a public linkage function being a compile error.</p>\n<p>I believe @engf was on the right track in his comment on your question, you need a friend class defined in the same translation unit as the class you wish it to be able to access.
