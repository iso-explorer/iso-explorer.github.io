This is most often used for long strings -- anything more than one line long:</p>\n<pre><code>char whatever[] = \"this is the first line of the string\\n\"\n    \"this is the second line of the string\\n\"\n    \"This is the third line of the string\";\n</code></pre>\n<p>Before string concatenation was invented, you had to do that with a rather clumsy line continuation, putting a backslash at the end of each line (and making sure it was the end, because most compilers wouldn't treat it as line continuation if there was any whitespace after the backslash). There was also ugliness with it throwing off indentation, because any whitespace at the beginning of subsequent lines might be included in the string.</p>\n<p>This can cause a minor problem if you intended to put a comma between the strings, such as when initializing an array of pointers to char. If you miss a comma, the compiler won't warn you about it -- you'll just get one string that includes what was intended to be two separate ones.</p>\n", "OwnerUserId": "179910", "PostTypeId": "2", "Id": "9892422", "Score": "9", "CreationDate": "2012-03-27T15:15:51.880", "LastActivityDate": "2012-03-27T15:15:51.880"}, "9892462": {"ParentId": "9892369", "CommentCount": "0", "Body": "<p>Simply putting strings one after the other concatenates them at compile time, so:</p>\n<pre><code>\"Hello\" \", \" \"World!\" =&gt; \"Hello, World!\"\n</code></pre>\n<p>This is a strange usage of the feature, usually it is to allow <code>#define</code> strings to be used:</p>\n<pre><code>#define FOO \"World!\"\n\nputs(\"Hello, \" FOO);\n</code></pre>\n<p>Will compile to the same as:</p>\n<pre><code>puts(\"Hello, World!\");\n</code></pre>\n", "OwnerUserId": "611562", "PostTypeId": "2", "Id": "9892462", "Score": "0", "CreationDate": "2012-03-27T15:17:42.580", "LastActivityDate": "2012-03-27T15:17:42.580"}, "9892450": {"ParentId": "9892369", "CommentCount": "0", "Body": "<p>Adjacent string literals are <a href=\"http://msdn.microsoft.com/en-us/library/69ze775t%28v=vs.80%29.aspx\" rel=\"nofollow\">concatenated</a>:</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p id=\"so_9892369_9892450_0\">When specifying string literals, adjacent strings are concatenated.\n  Therefore, this declaration:</p>\n<p id=\"so_9892369_9892450_1\">char szStr[] = \"12\" \"34\"; is identical to this declaration:</p>\n<p id=\"so_9892369_9892450_2\">char szStr[] = \"1234\"; This concatenation of adjacent strings makes it\n  easy to specify long strings across multiple lines:</p>\n<p id=\"so_9892369_9892450_3\">cout &lt;&lt; \"Four score and seven years \"<br>\n          \"ago, our forefathers brought forth \"<br>\n          \"upon this continent a new nation.\";</br></br></p>\n</blockquote>\n", "OwnerUserId": "1214731", "PostTypeId": "2", "Id": "9892450", "Score": "2", "CreationDate": "2012-03-27T15:16:54.307", "LastActivityDate": "2012-03-27T15:16:54.307"}, "9892415": {"ParentId": "9892369", "PostTypeId": "2", "CommentCount": "0", "Body": "<pre><code>const char version[] = \" version \" \"0\" \".\" \"8\" \".\" \"0\";\n</code></pre>\n<p>is same as:</p>\n<pre><code>const char version[] = \" version 0.8.0\";\n</code></pre>\n<p>Compiler concatenates the <em>adjacent</em> pieces of string-literals, making one bigger piece of string-literal.</p>\n<p>As a sidenote, <code>const char*</code> (which is in your title) is not same as <code>char char[]</code> (which is in your posted code).</p>\n", "OwnerUserId": "415784", "LastEditorUserId": "415784", "LastEditDate": "2012-03-27T15:22:07.570", "Id": "9892415", "Score": "3", "CreationDate": "2012-03-27T15:15:29.990", "LastActivityDate": "2012-03-27T15:22:07.570"}, "9892440": {"ParentId": "9892369", "CommentCount": "1", "Body": "<p>The compiler automatically concatenates string literals written after each other (separated by white-space only)..
