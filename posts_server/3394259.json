In the C99 standard that results in undefined behaviour.  It's probably the same in whatever C++ standard MS VC++ is built to.</p>\n<p>The reason for this is to allow compiler designers to take advantage of any CPU hardware support for shifts.  For example, the i386 architecture has an instruction to shift a 32 bit word by a number of bits, but the number of bits is defined in a field in the instruction that is 5 bits wide.  Most likely, your compiler is generating the instruction by taking your bit shift amount and masking it with 0x1F to get the bit shift in the instruction.  This means that shifting by 32 is the same as shifting by 0.</p>\n", "OwnerUserId": "169346", "PostTypeId": "2", "Id": "3394552", "Score": "3", "CreationDate": "2010-08-03T07:50:31.617", "LastActivityDate": "2010-08-03T07:50:31.617"}, "3394259": {"CommentCount": "3", "AcceptedAnswerId": "3394302", "PostTypeId": "1", "LastEditorUserId": "387076", "CreationDate": "2010-08-03T06:59:44.183", "LastActivityDate": "2017-10-16T12:21:04.407", "LastEditDate": "2017-10-16T12:21:04.407", "ViewCount": "3175", "FavoriteCount": "4", "Title": "Weird behavior of right shift operator (1 >> 32)", "Id": "3394259", "Score": "21", "Body": "<p>I recently faced a strange behavior using the right-shift operator.</p>\n<p>The following program:</p>\n<pre><code>#include &lt;cstdio&gt;\n#include &lt;cstdlib&gt;\n#include &lt;iostream&gt;\n#include &lt;stdint.h&gt;\n\nint foo(int a, int b)\n{\n   return a &gt;&gt; b;\n}\n\nint bar(uint64_t a, int b)\n{\n   return a &gt;&gt; b;\n}\n\nint main(int argc, char** argv)\n{\n    std::cout &lt;&lt; \"foo(1, 32): \" &lt;&lt; foo(1, 32) &lt;&lt; std::endl;\n    std::cout &lt;&lt; \"bar(1, 32): \" &lt;&lt; bar(1, 32) &lt;&lt; std::endl;\n    std::cout &lt;&lt; \"1 &gt;&gt; 32: \" &lt;&lt; (1 &gt;&gt; 32) &lt;&lt; std::endl; //warning here\n    std::cout &lt;&lt; \"(int)1 &gt;&gt; (int)32: \" &lt;&lt; ((int)1 &gt;&gt; (int)32) &lt;&lt; std::endl; //warning here\n\n    return EXIT_SUCCESS;\n}\n</code></pre>\n<p>Outputs:</p>\n<pre><code>foo(1, 32): 1 // Should be 0 (but I guess I'm missing something)\nbar(1, 32): 0\n1 &gt;&gt; 32: 0\n(int)1 &gt;&gt; (int)32: 0\n</code></pre>\n<p>What happens with the <code>foo()</code> function ?
