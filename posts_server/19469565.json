I think that there are some contradictions in the C++ Standard description. For example in section 9.2 Class members there is said</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p id=\"so_19469565_19469923_0\">1 The member-specification in a class definition declares the full set\n  of members of the class; no member can be added elsewhere.</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>So if to follow the Standard in your example there are indeed only 6 members because only they take part in the member-specification.</p>\n<p>Also according to the C++ Standard </p>\n<blockquote>\n<p id=\"so_19469565_19469923_1\">Members of a class are data members, member functions (9.3),...</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>If to look through section 9.3 then we will see that constructors, destructors and copy and move assignment operators are not mentioned there.:) They are called special member functions. But special member functions are not mentioned among member functions.</p>\n<p>So you can say bravely that there are only 6 class members. If somebody have questions then let he ask the C++ Standard Committee.:)</p>\n", "OwnerUserId": "2877241", "PostTypeId": "2", "Id": "19469923", "Score": "0", "CreationDate": "2013-10-19T19:07:57.067", "LastActivityDate": "2013-10-19T19:07:57.067"}, "bq_ids": {"n4140": {"so_19469565_19480241_1": {"section_id": 361, "quality": 0.7241379310344828, "length": 21}, "so_19469565_19480241_0": {"section_id": 5861, "quality": 1.0, "length": 6}, "so_19469565_19480241_2": {"section_id": 361, "quality": 1.0, "length": 7}, "so_19469565_19469923_1": {"section_id": 5861, "quality": 1.0, "length": 6}, "so_19469565_19469923_0": {"section_id": 5861, "quality": 0.9230769230769231, "length": 12}}, "n3337": {"so_19469565_19480241_1": {"section_id": 351, "quality": 0.7241379310344828, "length": 21}, "so_19469565_19480241_0": {"section_id": 5631, "quality": 1.0, "length": 6}, "so_19469565_19480241_2": {"section_id": 3082, "quality": 0.5714285714285714, "length": 4}, "so_19469565_19469923_1": {"section_id": 5631, "quality": 1.0, "length": 6}, "so_19469565_19469923_0": {"section_id": 5631, "quality": 0.9230769230769231, "length": 12}}, "n4659": {"so_19469565_19480241_1": {"section_id": 373, "quality": 0.7241379310344828, "length": 21}, "so_19469565_19480241_0": {"section_id": 7340, "quality": 1.0, "length": 6}, "so_19469565_19480241_2": {"section_id": 373, "quality": 1.0, "length": 7}, "so_19469565_19469923_1": {"section_id": 7340, "quality": 1.0, "length": 6}, "so_19469565_19469923_0": {"section_id": 7340, "quality": 0.9230769230769231, "length": 12}}}, "19480241": {"ParentId": "19469565", "CommentCount": "0", "Body": "<p>This is for C++ 11.</p>\n<p><strong>\u00a7 9.2 Class members:</strong></p>\n<blockquote>\n<p id=\"so_19469565_19480241_0\">Members of a class are data members, member functions (9.3), ...</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p><strong>\u00a7 12 Special member functions:</strong></p>\n<blockquote>\n<p id=\"so_19469565_19480241_1\">The default constructor (12.1), copy constructor and copy assignment operator (12.8), move constructor and move assignment operator (12.8), and destructor (12.4) are special member functions.
