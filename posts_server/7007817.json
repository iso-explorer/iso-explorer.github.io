What type does it represent?  My thought is that it would be some sort of function type, but I can't see how the name <code>cin</code> gets used.  Is it declaring that the parameter is an <code>istream_iterator&lt;int&gt;</code> named <code>cin</code>?

Just as for the ambiguities mentioned in 6.8, the resolution is to consider any construct that could possibly be a declaration a declaration.</strong> [Note: a declaration can be explicitly disambiguated by a nonfunction-style cast, by a = to indicate initialization or by removing the redundant parentheses around the parameter name. ] </p>\n</blockquote>\n<pre><code>[Example:\n\nstruct S {\n    S(int);\n};\n\nvoid foo(double a)\n{\n   S w(int(a));  // function declaration\n   S x(int());   // function declaration\n   S y((int)a);  // object declaration\n   S z = int(a); // object declaration\n}\n\u2014end example]\n</code></pre>\n<blockquote>\n<p id=\"so_7007817_7009105_2\">2 - The ambiguity arising from the similarity between a function-style cast and a type-id can occur in different contexts.
