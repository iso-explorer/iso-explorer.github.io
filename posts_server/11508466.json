A long time ago, variables defaulted to <code>int</code> in MSVC 2003's C++, but in standard C++, that has been illegal since the language was standardized.  In fact, when I type your code into recent versions of MSVC, I get the error message:</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p id=\"so_11508466_11508563_0\">error C4430: missing type specifier - int assumed. Note: C++ does not support default-int</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>To my knowledge, leaving out the <code>=</code> was never legal in C or C++.</p>\n<p>There are <em>some</em> cases where C and C++ will zero initialize variables to zero, but they are cases where you have something along the lines of <code>int a = int();</code>, and globals/statics are zero-initialized.  In your code, (if they're in a function) neither C nor C++ will zero initialize those variables.</p>\n", "LastEditorUserId": "845092", "LastActivityDate": "2012-07-16T16:41:56.700", "Score": "1", "CreationDate": "2012-07-16T16:30:33.840", "ParentId": "11508466", "CommentCount": "0", "OwnerUserId": "845092", "LastEditDate": "2012-07-16T16:41:56.700"}, "11508524": {"Id": "11508524", "PostTypeId": "2", "Body": "<p>According to the standard (C99, I haven't checked C++ or earlier C versions), neither of these is true.</p>\n<ol>\n<li><p>If you look at the grammar definition for declarations (section 6.7), you will find that the type specifier is not optional.</p></li>\n<li><p>On default initialisation (section 6.7.8), we find the following:</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p id=\"so_11508466_11508524_0\">If an object that has automatic storage duration is not initialized\n  explicitly, its value is indeterminate.
