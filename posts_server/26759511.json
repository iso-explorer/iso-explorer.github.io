Otherwise such a variable is\n      initialized the first time control passes through its declaration; such a variable is considered initialized upon\n      the completion of its initialization. If the initialization exits by throwing an exception, the initialization\n      is not complete, so it will be tried again the next time control enters the declaration. If control enters\n      the declaration concurrently while the variable is being initialized, the concurrent execution shall wait for\n      completion of the initialization.92 If control re-enters the declaration recursively while the variable is being\n      initialized, the behavior is undefined.
