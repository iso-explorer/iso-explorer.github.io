There has been extensive discussion about the individual features combined here, but I don't see anything about their interaction.</p>\n<p>Implementing this gets hairy as it comes down to returning an optional, variable-length array by value. Because the <code>std::initializer_list</code> doesn't own its contents, the function has to also return something else which does. When passing to a function, this is simply a local, fixed-size array. But in the other direction, the VLA needs to be returned on the stack, along with the <code>std::initializer_list</code>'s pointers. Then the caller needs to be told whether to dispose of the sequence (whether they're on the stack or not).</p>\n<p>The issue is very easy to stumble upon by returning a braced-init-list from a lambda function, as a \"natural\" way to return a few temporary objects without caring how they're contained.</p>\n<pre><code>auto &amp;&amp; il = []() -&gt; std::initializer_list&lt; noisydt &gt;\n               { return { noisydt{}, noisydt{} }; }();\n</code></pre>\n<p>Indeed, this is similar to how I arrived here. But, it would be an error to leave out the <code>-&gt;</code> trailing-return-type because lambda return type deduction only occurs when an expression is returned, and a braced-init-list is not an expression.</p>\n</hr></hr></hr>", "AcceptedAnswerId": "17635374", "Title": "lifetime of a std::initializer_list return value", "CreationDate": "2013-03-08T03:58:31.373", "Id": "15286450", "CommentCount": "16", "FavoriteCount": "3", "PostTypeId": "1", "LastEditDate": "2013-03-08T08:23:09.477", "LastEditorUserId": "153285", "LastActivityDate": "2013-07-14T00:18:33.907", "Score": "21", "OwnerUserId": "153285", "Tags": "<c++><c++11><initializer-list><lifetime><brace-initialization>", "AnswerCount": "2"}, "15291159": {"Id": "15291159", "PostTypeId": "2", "Body": "<p><strong><code>std::initializer_list</code> is not a container, don't use it to pass values around and expect them to persist</strong></p>\n<p><a href=\"http://www.open-std.org/jtc1/sc22/wg21/docs/cwg_defects.html#1290\" rel=\"noreferrer\">DR 1290</a> changed the wording, you should also be aware of <a href=\"http://www.open-std.org/jtc1/sc22/wg21/docs/cwg_active.html#1565\" rel=\"noreferrer\">1565</a> and <a href=\"http://www.open-std.org/jtc1/sc22/wg21/docs/cwg_active.html#1599\" rel=\"noreferrer\">1599</a> which aren't ready yet.</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p id=\"so_15286450_15291159_0\">Then the return value's array should also survive into the calling function, and it should be possible to preserve it by binding it to a named reference.</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>No, that doesn't follow.
