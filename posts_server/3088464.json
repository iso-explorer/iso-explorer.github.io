They have very similar semantics, and, you cannot define a copy constructor outside of a class just like other constructor. So, they didn't want to separate the twins far apart (to avoid the twins paradox:).</p>\n<p>P.S. What's a shame in C++, is that you cannot add a member to existing class. There's no low-level reason for that. If it would be possible, you could decouple header and cpp dependencies by not declaring private functions in the class definition header.</p>\n", "OwnerUserId": "73656", "PostTypeId": "2", "Id": "3088501", "Score": "-1", "CreationDate": "2010-06-21T21:02:56.513", "LastActivityDate": "2010-06-21T21:02:56.513"}, "bq_ids": {"n4140": {"so_3088464_3088474_0": {"section_id": 660, "quality": 0.8181818181818182, "length": 9}}, "n3337": {"so_3088464_3088474_0": {"section_id": 650, "quality": 0.8181818181818182, "length": 9}}, "n4659": {"so_3088464_3088474_0": {"section_id": 688, "quality": 0.8181818181818182, "length": 9}}}});
