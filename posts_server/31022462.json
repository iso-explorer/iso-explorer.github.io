Members of\n  a class are data members, member functions (9.3), nested types, and\n  enumerators. Data members and member functions are static or\n  non-static; see 9.4. Nested types are classes (9.1, 9.7) and\n  enumerations (7.2) defined in the class, and arbitrary types declared\n  as members by use of a typedef declaration (7.1.3). The enumerators of\n  an unscoped enumeration (7.2) defined in the class are members of the\n  class. Except when used to declare friends (11.3) or to introduce the\n  name of a member of a base class into a derived class (7.3.3),\n  member-declarations declare members of the class, and each such\n  member-declaration shall declare at least one member name of the\n  class. A member shall not be declared twice in the\n  member-specification, except that a nested class or member class\n  template can be declared and then later defined, and except that an\n  enumeration can be introduced with an opaque-enum-declaration and\n  later redeclared with an enum-specifier.</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>Also class members are</p>\n<pre><code>using-declaration\nstatic_assert-declaration\ntemplate-declaration\nalias-declaration\n</code></pre>\n", "CreationDate": "2015-06-24T09:20:59.870", "ParentId": "31022462", "Id": "31022627", "LastActivityDate": "2015-06-24T09:20:59.870", "PostTypeId": "2", "Score": "1", "OwnerUserId": "2877241"}, "31022530": {"LastActivityDate": "2015-06-24T09:41:38.367", "CommentCount": "0", "Body": "<p>A member is some entity that belongs to a class.</p>\n<p>If a class has a function, this is a member function - you might know it as \"a method\".<br/>\nIf a class has a variable, this is a member variable - you might know it as \"a property\".<br/></p>\n<pre><code>int a;\nvoid f () {};\n\nclass A{\n int m_A;\n  void m_F(){}\n}\n</code></pre>\n<p><code>a</code> is a global variable.<br/>\n<code>f</code> is a global function.<br/>\n<code>m_A</code> is a member variable or \"property\" of the class <code>A</code>.<br/>\n<code>m_F</code> is a member function or \"method\" of the class <code>A</code>.<br/></p>\n", "CreationDate": "2015-06-24T09:16:36.933", "LastEditDate": "2015-06-24T09:41:38.367", "ParentId": "31022462", "Id": "31022530", "LastEditorUserId": "3747990", "PostTypeId": "2", "Score": "3", "OwnerUserId": "3613500"}});
