If the compiler complains about your misuse of defaulted functions, you function is not a special one.</p>\n<p>When any other constructor than special constructors is added, the default constructor is not generated. That function being a template makes no different effect than a non template one.

If there is no user-declared constructor for class X, a constructor having no parameters is implicitly declared as defaulted (8.4).</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>Since your class has a user provided constructor, no implicitly declared/defined constructor is generated. Again, you can always force it's generation with <code>= default</code>.</p>\n", "LastEditorUserId": "2104697", "LastActivityDate": "2017-07-06T19:19:15.180", "Score": "7", "CreationDate": "2017-07-06T13:47:46.227", "ParentId": "44950083", "CommentCount": "4", "OwnerUserId": "2104697", "LastEditDate": "2017-07-06T19:19:15.180"}, "bq_ids": {"n4140": {"so_44950083_44950815_1": {"length": 18, "quality": 1.0, "section_id": 369}}, "n3337": {"so_44950083_44950815_1": {"length": 18, "quality": 1.0, "section_id": 359}}, "n4659": {"so_44950083_44950815_1": {"length": 16, "quality": 0.8888888888888888, "section_id": 381}}}, "44950083": {"ViewCount": "57", "Body": "<pre><code>template&lt;class T&gt;\nclass MyClass {\n public:\n  //MyClass() = default;\n\n template&lt;class X&gt;\n MyClass(MyClass&lt;X&gt;&amp; other)\n {\n  val = other.getVal();\n }\n\n T getVal()\n {\n  return val;\n }\n\n private:\n  T val;\n};\n\nmain()\n{\n MyClass&lt;double&gt; xd;       //this one causing the problem\n MyClass&lt;double&gt; xd1(xd);  //this one is fine\n\n MyClass&lt;int&gt; xi(xd);\n}\n</code></pre>\n<p>This code will not compile.\nBut if you uncomment MyClass() = default, then everything is fine.\nAs far as I remember the <strong>template ctor not preventing compiler from generating the default ctor and copy ctor as well</strong>. \nAnd indeed the compiler complaining only when trying to create object through the default ctor, but not for copy construction (which in this case is compiler generated)\nThe code was compiled with g++ 5.4.0 and 7.1.0.
