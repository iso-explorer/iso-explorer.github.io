post_cb({"1190112": {"ViewCount": "1824", "Body": "<p>Does the C++ Standard say I should be able to compare two default-constructed STL iterators for equality?  Are default-constructed iterators equality-comparable?</p>\n<p>I want the following, using std::list for example:</p>\n<pre><code>void foo(const std::list&lt;int&gt;::iterator iter) {\n    if (iter == std::list&lt;int&gt;::iterator()) {\n        // Something\n    }\n}\n\nstd::list&lt;int&gt;::iterator i;\nfoo(i);\n</code></pre>\n<p>What I want here is something like a NULL value for iterators, but I'm not sure if it's legal.  In the STL implementation included with Visual Studio 2008, they include assertions in std::list's operator==() that preclude this usage.  (They check that each iterator is \"owned\" by the same container and default-constructed iterators have no container.)  This would hint that it's not legal, or perhaps that they're being over-zealous.</p>\n", "AcceptedAnswerId": "1190275", "Title": "Comparing default-constructed iterators with operator==", "CreationDate": "2009-07-27T19:24:42.743", "Id": "1190112", "CommentCount": "1", "FavoriteCount": "3", "PostTypeId": "1", "LastEditDate": "2009-07-27T19:30:01.390", "LastEditorDisplayName": "anon", "LastActivityDate": "2014-06-10T15:39:46.843", "Score": "11", "OwnerUserId": "23624", "Tags": "<c++><visual-studio-2008><stl><iterator>", "AnswerCount": "4"}, "1190135": {"Id": "1190135", "PostTypeId": "2", "Body": "<p>I believe you should pass a <strong>range</strong> to the function.</p>\n<pre><code>void fun(std::list&lt;int&gt;::iterator beg, std::list&lt;int&gt;::iterator end)\n{\n    while(beg != end)\n    {\n        // do what you want here.\n        beg++;\n    }\n}\n</code></pre>\n", "LastActivityDate": "2009-07-27T19:29:27.430", "CommentCount": "7", "CreationDate": "2009-07-27T19:29:27.430", "ParentId": "1190112", "Score": "1", "OwnerUserId": "127893"}, "bq_ids": {"n4140": {"so_1190112_1190275_0": {"length": 32, "quality": 0.8888888888888888, "section_id": 5559}, "so_1190112_24145199_0": {"length": 12, "quality": 1.0, "section_id": 5574}}, "n3337": {"so_1190112_1190275_0": {"length": 32, "quality": 0.8888888888888888, "section_id": 5341}}, "n4659": {"so_1190112_1190275_0": {"length": 32, "quality": 0.8888888888888888, "section_id": 7006}, "so_1190112_24145199_0": {"length": 12, "quality": 1.0, "section_id": 7021}}}, "1190275": {"Id": "1190275", "PostTypeId": "2", "Body": "<p>OK, I'll take a stab.
