Storage management is handled automatically, though hints\n  can be given to improve efficiency. <strong>The elements of a vector are\n  stored contiguously</strong>, meaning that if v is a vector where T is some\n  type other than bool, then it obeys the identity <code>&amp;v[n] == &amp;v[0] + n</code>\n  for all <code>0 &lt;= n &lt; v.size()</code>.</p>\n</blockquote>\n", "OwnerUserId": "525217", "LastEditorUserId": "517503", "LastEditDate": "2013-11-01T13:56:20.673", "Id": "19728048", "Score": "21", "CreationDate": "2013-11-01T13:47:12.350", "LastActivityDate": "2013-11-01T13:56:20.673"}, "19728012": {"CommentCount": "3", "ViewCount": "612", "PostTypeId": "1", "ClosedDate": "2013-11-01T15:29:39.150", "LastEditorUserId": "1670308", "CreationDate": "2013-11-01T13:45:51.317", "LastActivityDate": "2013-11-01T15:26:28.377", "Title": "is it portable to treat std::vector like array", "AcceptedAnswerId": "19728048", "LastEditDate": "2013-11-01T15:26:28.377", "Id": "19728012", "Score": "12", "Body": "<p>I have seen people in my team writing code like this.
