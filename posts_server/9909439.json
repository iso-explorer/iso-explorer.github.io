On the other hand, if the base class has no <code>virtual</code> method at all, then inheritance is probably the wrong tool for the job. <em>For example:</em> in your case if I use <code>SafeVector&lt;T&gt; sv; sv[3];</code> then it is safe, however if I do <code>std::vector&lt;T&gt;&amp; v = sv; v[3];</code> it is not... this is because you are merely <em>hiding</em> the base class method, not overriding it (crank up your warning level, they'll let you know).</p>\n<p>The proper way here would be to use composition, and then create forwarding methods to the implementation member for those methods you really use. In practice, it gets tiring because C++ does not support delegation (<code>using attribute.insert;</code>) so many resort to inheriting...</p>\n<p>Another alternative is to provide the safer methods as free methods, since you can always add free methods without restriction. It might feel less idiomatic to people with the \"OO\" mindset, and some operators cannot be so added.</p>\n", "LastActivityDate": "2012-03-28T14:50:46.933", "CommentCount": "0", "CreationDate": "2012-03-28T14:50:46.933", "ParentId": "9909439", "Score": "6", "OwnerUserId": "147192"}, "bq_ids": {"n4140": {"so_9909439_9909559_1": {"length": 36, "quality": 0.9230769230769231, "section_id": 6107}, "so_9909439_9909559_0": {"length": 11, "quality": 0.6470588235294118, "section_id": 6105}}, "n3337": {"so_9909439_9909559_1": {"length": 36, "quality": 0.9230769230769231, "section_id": 5873}, "so_9909439_9909559_0": {"length": 11, "quality": 0.6470588235294118, "section_id": 5871}}, "n4659": {"so_9909439_9909559_1": {"length": 36, "quality": 0.9230769230769231, "section_id": 7604}, "so_9909439_9909559_0": {"length": 11, "quality": 0.6470588235294118, "section_id": 7602}}}, "9909439": {"ViewCount": "2246", "Body": "<p>I've always heard that you shouldn't inherit from a class without virtual destructors, and I didn't pay much attention because I just don't use inheritance all that often.
