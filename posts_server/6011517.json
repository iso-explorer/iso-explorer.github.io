My guess is that the the reason is that with two different typedefs you could end up with the same type in two different expressions. However when compiler stores the data structures, requiring the check would require compiler to \"evaluate\" the type expression to it's normal form. Church-Rosser theorem would need to be used inside the compiler to prove that the two expressions are equivalent. The operation used in typedefs is just plain old substitution, so full church-rosser would be required. So guess they made it optional.
