Otherwise, it supports equivalent keys. unordered_set and unordered_map support unique keys. unordered_multiset and unordered_multimap support equivalent keys. In containers that support equivalent keys, elements with equivalent keys are adjacent to each other in the iteration order of the container. Thus, although <strong>the absolute order of elements in an unordered container is not specified</strong>, its elements are grouped into equivalent-key groups such that all elements of each group have equivalent keys. Mutating operations on unordered containers shall preserve the relative order of elements within each equivalent-key group unless otherwise specified.</p>\n</blockquote>\n", "OwnerUserId": "2079303", "LastEditorUserId": "2079303", "LastEditDate": "2016-12-31T03:04:02.277", "Id": "41404983", "Score": "0", "CreationDate": "2016-12-31T02:45:53.050", "LastActivityDate": "2016-12-31T03:04:02.277"}, "41404733": {"CommentCount": "3", "ViewCount": "144", "PostTypeId": "1", "LastEditorUserId": "560648", "CreationDate": "2016-12-31T01:47:21.633", "LastActivityDate": "2017-03-17T13:35:46.333", "Title": "loop a std::unordered_map, the sequence is always the sequence I insert elements?", "AcceptedAnswerId": "41404983", "LastEditDate": "2017-03-17T13:35:46.333", "Id": "41404733", "Score": "1", "Body": "<p>I constructed a std::unordered_map and use for loop to visit it.\nI found that the sequence of the iteration result shows the elements is put in the sequence that I created those elements, no matter how I inserted them. </p>\n<p>Is this part of C++ standard that unordered_map, when visited, the iteration sequence is the insertion sequence?
