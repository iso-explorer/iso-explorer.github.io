[ Note: The lifetime of exception objects is\n  described in 15.1. \u2014 end note ] Even when the creation of the\n  temporary object is unevaluated (Clause 5) or otherwise avoided\n  (12.8), all the semantic restrictions shall be respected as if the\n  temporary object had been created and later destroyed. [ Note: even if\n  there is no call to the destructor or copy/move constructor, all the\n  semantic restrictions, such as accessibility (Clause 11) and whether\n  the function is deleted (8.4.3), shall be satisfied. However, in the\n  special case of a function call used as the operand of a\n  decltype-specifier (5.2.2), no temporary is introduced, so the\n  foregoing does not apply to the prvalue of any such function call. \u2014\n  end note ]</p>\n</blockquote>\n", "Tags": "<c++><language-lawyer>", "LastEditDate": "2017-07-24T16:53:03.123", "LastActivityDate": "2017-07-24T21:02:01.067", "PostTypeId": "1", "AnswerCount": "1", "OwnerUserId": "8221510"}, "45284333": {"LastActivityDate": "2017-07-24T21:02:01.067", "CommentCount": "0", "Body": "<p>There are certain contexts where you can type an expression that doesn't actually get executed at runtime.
