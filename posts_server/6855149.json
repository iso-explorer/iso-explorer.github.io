Trigraph sequences are replaced by corresponding single-character internal representations.<br>\n  3. The source file is decomposed into preprocessing tokens.<br>\n  4. Macro invocations are expanded.</br></br></p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>Phase 1 is defined by <code>[lex.trigraph]p1</code>. At this stage, your code is translated to <code>const char *trigraph = RAW(\"(#)\")</code>.</p>\n<p>Phase 3 is defined by <code>[lex.pptoken]</code>. This is the stage where trigraphs are reverted in raw string literals. Paragraph 3 says:</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p id=\"so_6855149_9651803_1\">If the next character begins a sequence of characters that could be the pre\ufb01x and initial double quote of a raw string literal, such as R\", the next preprocessing token shall be a raw string literal. Between the initial and \ufb01nal double quote characters of the raw string, any transformations performed in phases 1 and 2 (trigraphs, universal-character-names, and line splicing) are reverted.</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>That is not the case in your example, therefore the trigraph is not reverted. Your code is transformed into the <em>preprocessing-token</em> sequence <code>const</code> <code>char</code> <code>*</code> <code>trigraph</code> <code>=</code> <code>RAW</code> <code>(</code> <code>\"(#)\"</code> <code>)</code></p>\n<p>Finally, in phase 4, the <code>RAW</code> macro is expanded and the token-paste occurs, resulting in the following sequence of <em>preprocessing-tokens</em>: <code>const</code> <code>char</code> <code>*</code> <code>trigraph</code> <code>=</code> <code>R\"(#)\"</code>. The <em>r-char-sequence</em> of the string literal comprises a <code>#</code>. Phase 3 has already occurred, and there is no other point at which reversion of trigraphs occurs.</p>\n", "OwnerUserId": "1041090", "PostTypeId": "2", "Id": "9651803", "Score": "6", "CreationDate": "2012-03-11T02:03:18.397", "LastActivityDate": "2012-03-11T02:03:18.397"}, "6855149": {"CommentCount": "3", "AcceptedAnswerId": "9651803", "PostTypeId": "1", "LastEditorUserId": "500104", "CreationDate": "2011-07-28T06:59:09.683", "LastActivityDate": "2012-03-11T02:07:32.783", "LastEditDate": "2012-03-11T02:07:32.783", "ViewCount": "498", "FavoriteCount": "2", "Title": "Are trigraph substitutions reverted when a raw string is created through concatenation?", "Id": "6855149", "Score": "9", "Body": "<p>It's pretty common to use macros and token concatenation to switch between wide and narrow strings at compile time.</p>\n<pre><code>#define _T(x) L##x\nconst wchar_t *wide1 = _T(\"hello\");\nconst wchar_t *wide2 = L\"hello\";\n</code></pre>\n<p>And in C++11 it should be valid to concoct a similar thing with raw strings:</p>\n<pre><code>#define RAW(x) R##x\nconst char *raw1 = RAW(\"(Hello)\");\nconst char *raw2 = R\"(Hello)\";\n</code></pre>\n<p>Since macro expansion and token concatenation happens before escape sequence substitution, this should prevent escape sequences being replaced in the quoted string.</p>\n<p>But how does this apply to trigraphs?
