If you're going to use an explicit loop, it usually makes more sense to just continue to use an index, at least for something like <code>string</code> that allows random access. The primary point of iterators is to enable generic algorithms that aren't coupled to containers. To make good use of an iterator, use it with an algorithm:</p>\n<pre><code>int main() { \n    std::string plaintext;\n    std::getline(std::cin, plaintext);\n\n    std::transform(plaintext.begin(), plaintext.end(), \n                   std::ostream_iterator&lt;char&gt;(std::cout), \n                   std::bind2nd(std::plus&lt;int&gt;(), 3));\n    return 0;\n}\n</code></pre>\n<p>Edit: Since Hans Passant brought it up, a version using a lambda expression would look like this:</p>\n<pre><code>std::transform(line.begin(), line.end(), \n               std::ostream_iterator&lt;char&gt;(std::cout), \n               [](char ch) { return ch+'\\03'; });\n</code></pre>\n<p>Only relatively recent compilers support this though -- gcc &gt;= 4.6, Visual Studio &gt;= 2010.</p>\n", "OwnerUserId": "179910", "LastEditorUserId": "179910", "LastEditDate": "2011-02-17T04:55:05.517", "Id": "5024308", "Score": "3", "CreationDate": "2011-02-17T01:55:24.500", "LastActivityDate": "2011-02-17T04:55:05.517"}, "5024585": {"ParentId": "5024218", "CommentCount": "1", "Body": "<blockquote>\n<p id=\"so_5024218_5024585_0\">[C++2003 Standard section 6.6.3-2] Flowing off the end of a\n  function is equivalent to a return\n  with no value; this results in\n  undefined behavior in a\n  value-returning function.</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>This is a very easy mistake to make if your compiler doesn't warn you.

Since <code>encrypt</code> doesn't actually return anything, the destructor ends up getting called for an object that doesn't exist.
