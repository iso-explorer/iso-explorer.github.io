This is completely braindead - it should just give a good error message when you actually do define a member out of line.</p>\n<p>The correct thing to do is to disable this warning in every project ever and keep doing what you were doing.</p>\n<p><strong>Edit:</strong> Apparently, the people at Microsoft also realized just how stupid this warning was and removed it in newer versions. MSDN does not contain documentation for this warning for versions newer than Visual Studio 2008.</p>\n", "LastActivityDate": "2013-09-24T11:01:56.820"}, "18979503": {"CommentCount": "5", "ViewCount": "665", "PostTypeId": "1", "LastEditorUserId": "177584", "CreationDate": "2013-09-24T10:47:26.080", "LastActivityDate": "2013-09-24T11:01:56.820", "Title": "Why locally defined struct in function need assignment operator & copy constructor", "AcceptedAnswerId": "18979812", "LastEditDate": "2013-09-24T10:54:39.710", "Id": "18979503", "Score": "3", "Body": "<p>Can someone help me understanding this error , when i declare struct locally in function i get below errors from compiler.
