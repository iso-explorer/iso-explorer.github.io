It is extremely useful in generic code.

Informally, you can think of <code>void</code> as a \"type\" representing an absence of type. Therefore, the compiler can't possibly know how to create a <code>void</code> object.

Unlike the plain <code>void</code>, <code>void*</code> is valid and simply means \"<em>a pointer to an object of some unknown type</em>\". Obviously you can't do much with a <code>void*</code> until you cast it into an actual, known type (assuming the cast is safe, of course).</p>\n", "OwnerUserId": "308661", "LastEditorUserId": "308661", "LastEditDate": "2011-03-25T21:14:20.510", "Id": "5429869", "Score": "13", "CreationDate": "2011-03-25T07:56:38.940", "LastActivityDate": "2011-03-25T21:14:20.510"}, "5429855": {"CommentCount": "3", "ViewCount": "1567", "PostTypeId": "1", "LastEditorUserId": "57428", "CreationDate": "2011-03-25T07:54:44.663", "LastActivityDate": "2011-03-25T21:14:20.510", "Title": "Why can't objects of type void be created in C++?", "AcceptedAnswerId": "5429869", "LastEditDate": "2011-03-25T07:57:57.467", "Id": "5429855", "Score": "14", "Body": "<p>C++ doesn't allow creating objects of type <code>void</code>.
