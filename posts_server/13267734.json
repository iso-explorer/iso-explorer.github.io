You might think that doesn't say much, but your example code <code>Class_name instance_name1 = instance_name2;</code> <em>doesn't</em> assign to an object, it initializes one. The difference is in the grammar of the language: in both cases the <code>=</code> symbol precedes something called an <em>initializer-clause</em>, but <code>Class_name instance_name1 = instance_name2;</code> is a definition, whereas <code>instance_name1 = instance_name2;</code> on its own after <code>instance_name1</code> has been defined is an <em>expression-statement</em> containing an <em>assignment-expression</em>. Assignment-expressions use assignment operators, definitions use constructors.</p>\n<p>If the usual rules for overload resolution select an assignment operator that is a copy assignment operator, then that's when a copy assignment operator is used:</p>\n<pre><code>X x;\nx = 4; // uses non-copy assignment operator\nX y;\ny = x; // uses copy assignment operator\n</code></pre>\n<p>The reason there's a distinction between copy and non-copy assignment operators, is that if you declare a copy assignment operator, that suppresses the default copy assignment operator. If you declare any non-copy assignment operators, they don't suppress the default copy assignment.</p>\n", "LastEditorUserId": "13005", "LastActivityDate": "2012-11-07T10:53:58.723", "Score": "7", "CreationDate": "2012-11-07T10:30:12.690", "ParentId": "13267734", "CommentCount": "2", "OwnerUserId": "13005", "LastEditDate": "2012-11-07T10:53:58.723"}});
