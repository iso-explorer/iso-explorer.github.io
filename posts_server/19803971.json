If the access is to form\n  a pointer to member (5.3.1), the nested-name-specifier shall denote C\n  or a class derived from C. All other accesses involve a (possibly\n  implicit) object expression (5.2.5). <strong>In this case, the class of the\n  object expression shall be C or a class derived from C.</strong></p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>Code snippet:</p>\n<pre><code>class Base\n{\nprotected: \n    int i;\n};\n\nclass Derived : public Base\n{\npublic:\n    // I cannot define it as void memfunc(Derived* obj) because of signature requirement.\n    void memfunc(Base* obj) \n    {\n       obj-&gt;i = 0;  // ERROR, cannot access private member via Base*\n       Derived* dobj = (Derived*)(obj);\n       dobj-&gt;i = 0; // OK\n    }\n};\n</code></pre>\n<p>So what's the reason for this check?
