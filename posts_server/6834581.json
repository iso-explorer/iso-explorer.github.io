They're integral type, and most likely their type is just <code>int</code> because that is most natural type. So you can pass by value; passing by reference wouldn't give you any significant advantage.</p>\n<p>By the way, for your reference, the section \u00a77.2/5 says,</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p id=\"so_6834581_6834680_1\">The underlying type of an enumeration is an integral type that can\n  represent all the enumerator values defined in the enumeration. It is\n  <em>implementation-defined</em> which integral type is used as the underlying\n  type for an enumeration except that the underlying type shall not be\n  larger than int unless the value of an enumerator cannot fit in an int\n  or unsigned int. If the enumerator-list is empty, the underlying type\n  is as if the enumeration had a single enumerator with value 0. The\n  value of sizeof() applied to an enumeration type, an object of\n  enumeration type, or an enumerator, is the value of sizeof() applied\n  to the underlying type.</p>\n</blockquote>\n", "LastEditorUserId": "415784", "LastActivityDate": "2011-07-26T18:30:28.700", "Score": "1", "CreationDate": "2011-07-26T18:25:05.853", "ParentId": "6834581", "CommentCount": "0", "LastEditDate": "2011-07-26T18:30:28.700", "OwnerUserId": "415784"}, "6834614": {"Id": "6834614", "PostTypeId": "2", "Body": "<pre><code>typedef enum\n{\n    FIRST_THING,\n    SECOND_THING\n} myType;\n</code></pre>\n<p>Then use it just like an int.
