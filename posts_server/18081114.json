[...] An implicitly-declared copy [...] constructor is an inline public member of its class.</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>and finally 12.8.18, 12.8.20, 12.8.22:</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p id=\"so_18081114_18081262_2\">If the class definition does not explicitly declare a copy assignment operator, one is declared implicitly.
