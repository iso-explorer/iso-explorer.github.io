The array-to-pointer conversion is used to turn a glvalue into a prvalue, which is NOT what <code>++</code> needs. Therefore, nothing calls for the array-to-pointer conversion. It would actually be invalid to apply it, as the result of that conversion is a prvalue, on which <code>++</code> can not act.</p>\n", "LastEditorUserId": "1782465", "LastActivityDate": "2014-12-09T09:37:08.420", "Score": "1", "CreationDate": "2014-12-09T09:20:42.160", "ParentId": "27375117", "CommentCount": "0", "OwnerUserId": "1782465", "LastEditDate": "2014-12-09T09:37:08.420"}, "bq_ids": {"n4140": {"so_27375117_27375117_2": {"length": 31, "quality": 0.8857142857142857, "section_id": 6074}, "so_27375117_27375280_0": {"length": 17, "quality": 1.0, "section_id": 5942}, "so_27375117_27375117_1": {"length": 17, "quality": 0.9444444444444444, "section_id": 11}, "so_27375117_27375117_0": {"length": 26, "quality": 1.0, "section_id": 5356}}, "n3337": {"so_27375117_27375117_2": {"length": 31, "quality": 0.8857142857142857, "section_id": 5842}, "so_27375117_27375280_0": {"length": 17, "quality": 1.0, "section_id": 5713}, "so_27375117_27375117_1": {"length": 17, "quality": 0.9444444444444444, "section_id": 8}, "so_27375117_27375117_0": {"length": 26, "quality": 1.0, "section_id": 5153}}, "n4659": {"so_27375117_27375117_2": {"length": 24, "quality": 0.6857142857142857, "section_id": 7570}, "so_27375117_27375280_0": {"length": 17, "quality": 1.0, "section_id": 7426}, "so_27375117_27375117_1": {"length": 17, "quality": 0.9444444444444444, "section_id": 12}, "so_27375117_27375117_0": {"length": 26, "quality": 1.0, "section_id": 6781}}}, "27375117": {"ViewCount": "56", "Body": "<p>\u00a7 2.14.5/8 of the N3337 draft standard states:</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p id=\"so_27375117_27375117_0\">Ordinary string literals and UTF-8 string literals are also referred\n  to as narrow string literals.
