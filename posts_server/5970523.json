Why are you talking about leaking memory specifically?</p>\n<p>The code you posted produces <em>undefined behavior</em>. Anything can happen in this case: memory leaked, hard drive formatted, program crashed, etc.</p>\n<p>P.S. I know that there's a popular urban legend out there that performing polymorphic destruction without a virtual destructor \"might leak memory\". I don't know who invented that nonsense and why they decided to use \"leaking memory\" as the primary scenario for what might happen. In reality the behavior in this case has absolutely nothing to do with \"leaking memory\". The behavior is simply undefined.</p>\n<p>From the practical point of view, in your particular case it is rather obvious that there's no real chance for the destructor of your <code>auto_ptr</code> to get called, so the memory owned by that <code>auto_ptr</code> will certainly be leaked. But again, this is the least of this code's problems.</p>\n", "LastEditorUserId": "187690", "LastActivityDate": "2011-05-11T21:15:33.527", "Score": "9", "CreationDate": "2011-05-11T20:57:49.897", "ParentId": "5970523", "CommentCount": "1", "OwnerUserId": "187690", "LastEditDate": "2011-05-11T21:15:33.527"}, "5970523": {"ViewCount": "661", "Body": "<p>Given that a class and all its subclasses need no more than the default destructor to release their resources if stored in a variable of the exact type (or pointer to the exact type), can a subclass leak memory if referenced by a base class pointer and then deleted by that pointer?</p>\n<h2>Example:</h2>\n<pre><code>#include &lt;memory&gt;\n\nclass A {\n};\n\nclass B : public A {\npublic:\n    B () : pInt(new int) {}\n    auto_ptr&lt;int&gt; pInt; // this is what might leak... possibly more will though\n};\n\nvoid will_this_leak () {\n    A *pA = new B();\n    delete pA;\n}\n</code></pre>\n", "AcceptedAnswerId": "5970543", "Title": "Non-virtual trivial destructor + Inheritance", "CreationDate": "2011-05-11T20:55:47.510", "Id": "5970523", "CommentCount": "3", "FavoriteCount": "1", "PostTypeId": "1", "LastEditDate": "2011-05-11T21:01:52.083", "LastEditorUserId": "239916", "LastActivityDate": "2011-05-11T21:25:46.087", "Score": "2", "OwnerUserId": "239916", "Tags": "<c++><inheritance><destructor>", "AnswerCount": "4"}, "5970551": {"Id": "5970551", "PostTypeId": "2", "Body": "<p>It doesn't matter whether they can leak or not.
