I had a hypothesis, but no real evidence for it. However, the document the rule originated in (<a href=\"http://www.open-std.org/jtc1/sc22/wg21/docs/papers/2006/n2079.pdf\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">N2079</a> as linked by @T.C.) confirmed part of my theory.</p>\n<p>Note that the function that the rule comes from takes in a <code>std::seed_seq</code> object in the document, and not a templated class. This means that when the rule was written, it was made specifically for <code>std::seed_seq</code>, and not the concept of a SeedSequence in general. This means that we can look at the <code>std::seed_seq</code> class for information about this, specifically with how <code>std::seed_seq::generate</code> is defined.</p>\n<p>The method that <code>std::seed_seq::generate</code> uses is well explained <a href=\"http://en.cppreference.com/w/cpp/numeric/random/seed_seq/generate\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">on cppreference.com</a>. It's a bit complicated, but it can be summarized in 4 stages.</p>\n<ol>\n<li><p>Initialize the output range with some initial data (I'm including <code>k=0</code> here)</p></li>\n<li><p>Move the original seed data into the output range (<code>k=1..s</code>)</p></li>\n<li><p>Extend the seed data into the rest of the output range (<code>k=s+1..m-1</code> where <code>m=max(s+1, n)</code>)</p></li>\n<li><p>Shuffle the data in the output range (<code>k=m..m+n-1</code>)</p></li>\n</ol>\n<p>When seeding a <code>std::linear_congruential_engine</code> with the modulo &lt;= 2<sup>32</sup> (which includes <code>std::minstd_rand</code> and <code>std::minstd_rand0</code>), it should only need to generate 1 value from <code>std::seed_seq</code>, but with this rule, it generates 4. So what changes in this algorithm when changing <code>n</code> from 1 to 4?</p>\n<p>One part that changes is that the shuffling stage goes from 1 iteration to 4. Since one of the goals of <code>std::seed_seq</code> is to produce high quality seeding values \"given a small seed or a poorly distributed initial seed sequence.`, these extra shuffling iterations likely improve the resulting seed value. The reason why it drops the first 3 values instead of the last is because the later values are (usually) the ones that get shuffled more.</p>\n<p>It's also worth noting that a key equation of all 4 stages is the value <code>begin[k]^begin[k+p]^begin[k\u22121]</code> (with XOR replaced with addition in the last stage). When <code>n=1</code>, this simply becomes <code>begin[k]</code> (or <code>3*begin[k]</code> for the last stage) (note that \"the indexing of the output range <code>begin[x]</code> is taken modulo n\" and <code>x % 1 == 0</code>). When <code>n=4</code>, this equation works more like it was intended to, which helps shuffle the data around more effectively.</p>\n<p>So the short answer is that <code>std::linear_congruential_engine</code> discards 3 numbers generated by the seed sequence because having <code>std::seed_seq</code> generate those numbers improves the quality of the values it actually uses. Now, the decision to discard these numbers in the generator was decided before the <em>generic concept</em> of SeedSequence was defined, so it made more sense to solve the issue in the generator, instead of overcomplicating the seed sequence class. However, this now means that the first 3 values generated by <strong>any</strong> seed sequence are discarded. Whether or not that's worth it is probably debatable, but it is the way it is now.</p>\n", "LastEditorUserId": "641507", "LastActivityDate": "2017-08-18T07:25:25.873", "Score": "1", "CreationDate": "2017-08-18T06:25:10.240", "ParentId": "37927205", "CommentCount": "0", "LastEditDate": "2017-08-18T07:25:25.873", "OwnerUserId": "641507"}});
