So here is basically what I'm doing:</p>\n<pre><code>class Worker\n{\n   std::string arg1;\n   int arg2;\n   int arg3;\n   std::thread thread;\n\npublic:\n   Worker( std::string arg1, int arg2, int arg3 )\n   {\n      this-&gt;arg1 = arg1;\n      this-&gt;arg2 = arg2;\n      this-&gt;arg3 = arg3;\n   }\n\n   void DoWork()\n   {\n      this-&gt;thread = std::thread( &amp;Worker::Work, this );\n   }\n\nprivate:\n   Work()\n   {\n      // Do stuff with args\n   }\n}\n\nint main()\n{\n   Worker worker( \"some data\", 1, 2 );\n   worker.DoWork();\n\n   // Wait for it to finish\n   return 0;\n}\n</code></pre>\n<p>I was wondering, what steps do I need to take to make sure that the args are safe to access in the Work() function which runs on another thread. Is it enough that it's written in the constructor, and then the thread is created in a separate function? Or do I need a memory fence, and how do I make a memory fence to make sure all 3 args are written by the main thread, and then read by the Worker thread?</p>\n<p>Thanks for any help!</p>\n", "Tags": "<multithreading><c++11><thread-safety><memory-fences>", "OwnerUserId": "928838", "AnswerCount": "1"}, "bq_ids": {"n4140": {"so_17192991_17193859_0": {"section_id": 2711, "quality": 0.875, "length": 7}}, "n3337": {"so_17192991_17193859_0": {"section_id": 2672, "quality": 0.875, "length": 7}}, "n4659": {"so_17192991_17193859_0": {"section_id": 3451, "quality": 0.875, "length": 7}}}});
