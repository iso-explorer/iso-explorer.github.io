Is it a feature or a bug?", "LastEditDate": "2016-02-11T22:35:01.723", "Id": "35317344", "Score": "10", "Body": "<p>Imaging the case when you have an <code>unique_ptr</code> with a custom deleter stored by a reference:</p>\n<pre><code>struct CountingDeleter\n{\n    void operator()(std::string *p) {\n        ++cntr_;\n        delete p;\n    }\n\n    unsigned long cntr_ = 0;\n};\n\nint main()\n{\n    CountingDeleter d1{}, d2{};\n\n    {\n        std::unique_ptr&lt;std::string, CountingDeleter&amp;&gt;\n            p1(new std::string{\"first\"} , d1),\n            p2(new std::string{\"second\"}, d2);\n\n        p1 = std::move(p2); // does d1 = d2 under cover\n    }\n\n    std::cout &lt;&lt; \"d1 \" &lt;&lt; d1.cntr_ &lt;&lt; \"\\n\"; // output: d1 1\n    std::cout &lt;&lt; \"d2 \" &lt;&lt; d2.cntr_ &lt;&lt; \"\\n\"; // output: d2 0\n}\n</code></pre>\n<p>It was a surprise for me that the assignment in the code above has a side-effect of copying <code>d2</code> into <code>d1</code>. I've double check it and found that this behavior is as described in the standard in <a href=\"http://eel.is/c++draft/unique.ptr.single.asgn\" rel=\"noreferrer\">[unique.ptr.single.asgn]</a>:</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p id=\"so_35317344_35317344_0\">(1) - Requires: If <code>D</code> is not a reference type, <code>D</code> shall satisfy the requirements of <code>MoveAssignable</code> and assignment of the deleter from an rvalue of type <code>D</code> shall not throw an exception.\n  Otherwise, <code>D</code> is a reference type; <code>remove_reference_t&lt;D&gt;</code> shall satisfy the <code>CopyAssignable</code> requirements and assignment of the deleter from an lvalue of type <code>D</code> shall not throw an exception.</p>\n<p id=\"so_35317344_35317344_1\">(2) - Effects: Transfers ownership from <code>u</code> to <code>*this</code> as if by calling <code>reset(u.release())</code> followed by <code>get_deleter() = std::forward&lt;D&gt;(u.get_deleter())</code>.</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>To get the behavior that I expected (a shallow copy of the deleter reference) I had to wrap the deleter reference into <code>std::reference_wrapper</code>:</p>\n<pre><code>std::unique_ptr&lt;std::string, std::reference_wrapper&lt;CountingDeleter&gt;&gt;\n    p1(new std::string{\"first\"} , d1),\n    p2(new std::string{\"second\"}, d2);\n\np1 = std::move(p2); // p1 now stores reference to d2 =&gt; no side effects!\n</code></pre>\n<p>For me the current handling of a deleter reference in the unique ptr is counter-intuitive and even error-prone:</p>\n<ol>\n<li><p>When you store a deleter by a reference rather than by value this mostly because you want the shared deleter with some important unique state. So you don't expect the shared deleter is overwritten and its state is lost after a unique ptr assignment.</p></li>\n<li><p>It's expected that assignment of a unique_ptr is extremely chip, especially if the deleter is a reference. But instead of this, you get copying of the deleter what can be (unexpectedly) expensive.</p></li>\n<li><p>After the assignment, the pointer become bound to original deleter's copy, rather than to the original deleter itself. This might lead to some unexpected side-effects if the deleter's identity is important.</p></li>\n<li><p>Also, current behavior prevents from using a const reference to a deleter because you just can't copy into a const object.</p></li>\n</ol>\n<p>IMO it would be better to forbid a deleters of reference types and accept only a movable value types.</p>\n<p>So my question is the following (it looks like two questions in one, sorry):</p>\n<ul>\n<li><p>Is there any reason why the standard <code>unique_ptr</code> behaves like this?</p></li>\n<li><p>Does anybody have a good example where it's useful to have a reference type deleter in <code>unique_ptr</code> rather than a non-reference one (i.e. a value type)?</p></li>\n</ul>\n", "Tags": "<c++><c++11><smart-pointers><unique-ptr>", "OwnerUserId": "2572774", "AnswerCount": "3"}, "35317773": {"ParentId": "35317344", "LastEditDate": "2017-05-18T22:49:15.970", "CommentCount": "2", "CreationDate": "2016-02-10T14:24:43.347", "OwnerUserId": "464581", "LastEditorUserId": "464581", "PostTypeId": "2", "Id": "35317773", "Score": "0", "Body": "<p>A reference can't be reseated after initialization.
