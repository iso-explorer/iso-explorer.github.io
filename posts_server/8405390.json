(15.3 para. 13)</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>It makes specific mention of a <em>function-try-block</em> placed on <code>main()</code>, which strongly implies that such a structure is legal and has defined behavior. Adding in the information that <code>main()</code> is only special in its name and return type, and that implementations may not overload it to alter any behavior, makes a pretty strong case that it acts in a normal fashion except when specially noted such as in the above quote. In other words, <strong>yes, it is legal and well-defined.</strong></p>\n<p>The blog post I supplied in the first version of this answer actually does a good job of illustrating the rules given by the above blockquote, so I'll <a href=\"http://stupefydeveloper.blogspot.com/2008/10/c-function-try-catch-block.html\">retain the link to it</a>, even though it does not directly discuss the issue in the OP's question.</p>\n<p>Regarding a comment on the OP, you can issue return statements within a <em>function-try-block</em>, and [except.handle] has this to say:</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p id=\"so_8405390_8405690_1\">Flowing off the end of a function-try-block is equivalent to a return\n  with no value; this results in undefined behavior in a value-returning\n  function (6.6.3). (15.3 para. 15)</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>If you're in a catch-block at the end of <code>main</code>, you're not going to flow over the function's body (which would be the try-block in this case), so the rule that main automatically calls <code>return 0;</code> on flowover doesn't apply. You need to return some <code>int</code> (quite possibly an error code) to keep from becoming undefined.</p>\n", "LastEditorUserId": "593048", "LastActivityDate": "2011-12-06T21:26:44.677", "Score": "7", "CreationDate": "2011-12-06T19:34:35.063", "ParentId": "8405390", "CommentCount": "10", "LastEditDate": "2011-12-06T21:26:44.677", "OwnerUserId": "593048"}});
