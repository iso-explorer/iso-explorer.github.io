It was unclear what some storage classes would mean on a structured binding declaration, and exactly how to change the specification to allow <code>constexpr</code> (simply allowing it in the grammar wouldn't say what it means). A paper exploring the design space was requested. It should be possible to change this in future without breaking any code, but there wasn't time to do it for C++17.</p>\n", "LastEditorUserId": "981959", "LastActivityDate": "2017-05-15T10:27:37.867", "Score": "34", "CreationDate": "2017-01-12T21:07:48.937", "ParentId": "41622896", "CommentCount": "6", "OwnerUserId": "981959", "LastEditDate": "2017-05-15T10:27:37.867"}, "41622896": {"ViewCount": "1134", "Body": "<p>Consider the following snippet to test the upcoming C++17 feature decomposition declarations (formerly known as structured bindings)</p>\n<pre><code>#include &lt;cassert&gt;\n#include &lt;utility&gt;\n\nconstexpr auto divmod(int n, int d)\n{\n    return std::make_pair(n / d, n % d); // in g++7, also just std::pair{n/d, n%d}\n}\n\nint main()\n{\n    constexpr auto [q, r] = divmod(10, 3);\n    static_assert(q == 3 &amp;&amp; r ==1);\n}\n</code></pre>\n<p>This fails on both g++7-SVN and clang-4.0-SVN with the message: </p>\n<blockquote>\n<p id=\"so_41622896_41622896_0\">decomposition declaration cannot be declared 'constexpr'</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>Dropping the <code>constexpr</code> definition and changing to a regular <code>assert()</code> works on both compilers.</p>\n<p>None of the WG21 papers on this feature mention the <code>constexpr</code> keyword, neither in the positive nor the negative. </p>\n<p><strong>Question</strong>: why aren't decomposition declarations be allowed to be <code>constexpr</code>?
