It is\n  implementation-defined which integral type is used as the underlying\n  type except that the underlying type shall not be larger than int\n  unless the value of an enumerator cannot fit in an int or unsigned\n  int.</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>This means that it is possible that an <code>enum</code> is a larger type than an <code>int</code> so the conversion from <code>enum</code> to <code>int</code> <em>could</em> fail with undefined results.</p>\n<p>Subject to the above, it <em>is</em> possible to convert an <code>int</code> to an <code>enum</code> that results in an enumerator value that the <code>enum</code> does not specify explicitly.
