In modern larger processors, it's an instruction (x86 for example). Most often, this instruction will cause a trap when dividing by zero, and this applies whether the code is \"intending to use the modulo\" or \"quotient\" part. </p>\n<p>It is undefined so that processors and compilers have the freedom to implement what they fancy - e.g. if the processor just returns whatever came in as the input, that's also allowed, or if it causes the entire OS to crash, that's \"fine\" too by the standard. </p>\n<p>In summary, modulo of zero is just as bad as divide by zero. </p>\n<p>(Note that typically, floating point divide by zero does NOT trap [by default], and produces a infinity value, except if the value divided is also zero, in which case you get \"not a number\")</p>\n", "OwnerUserId": "1919155", "LastEditorUserId": "1919155", "LastEditDate": "2014-03-08T22:31:31.480", "Id": "22275776", "Score": "9", "CreationDate": "2014-03-08T22:16:58.567", "LastActivityDate": "2014-03-08T22:31:31.480"}, "22275745": {"ParentId": "22275684", "CommentCount": "14", "Body": "<p>Mathematically speaking you should get infinite, which is the correct answer... programmatically any sane compiler will warn you of division by zero as internally the modulo operator (at least in C/C++) is translated in a division (in most implementations).
