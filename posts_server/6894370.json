You've already gotten some reasonable explanations of how the built-in version work, but an overloaded <code>operator-&gt;</code> is somewhat unusual, so perhaps it's worth adding a bit about how it works.</p>\n<p>The standard describes how <code>operator-&gt;</code> is unusual fairly succinctly (\u00a713.5.6):</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p id=\"so_6894370_6901949_0\">An expression x-&gt;m is interpreted as (x.operator-&gt;())-&gt;m for a class object x of type T if T::operator-&gt;() exists and if the operator is selected as the best match function by the overload resolution mechanism (13.3).</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>This has a couple of implications: </p>\n<ol>\n<li>Even though <code>-&gt;</code> looks like a binary operator, from a viewpoint of overloading, it's essentially a unary operator -- your overload will be a member function that takes no argument.</li>\n<li>Your overload has to return one of two types: either a (reference to) an instance of another class that also overloads <code>operator-&gt;</code>, or else a pointer to some object (of class or struct type).</li>\n</ol>\n<p>Since you can return an object that itself overloads <code>operator-&gt;</code>, an expression of the form <code>x-&gt;m</code> can hide an arbitrary amount of complexity (an arbitrary number of functions being called). What you write as <code>x-&gt;m</code> could really expand out to <code>x-&gt;y-&gt;z-&gt;a-&gt;b-&gt;...m</code>.</p>\n", "OwnerUserId": "179910", "PostTypeId": "2", "Id": "6901949", "Score": "0", "CreationDate": "2011-08-01T17:11:44.680", "LastActivityDate": "2011-08-01T17:11:44.680"}, "6894400": {"ParentId": "6894370", "CommentCount": "0", "Body": "<ul>\n<li><code>a::b</code> -- <code>a</code> is a namespace or a class (not an instance), and consequently <code>b</code> needs to be some static entity</li>\n<li><code>a.b</code> -- <code>a</code> is an instance of a class and <code>b</code> is its member</li>\n<li><code>a-&gt;b</code> -- same as <code>(*a).b</code> (<code>a</code> is a pointer to an instance of a class)</li>\n</ul>\n", "OwnerUserId": "771837", "PostTypeId": "2", "Id": "6894400", "Score": "6", "CreationDate": "2011-08-01T05:08:24.993", "LastActivityDate": "2011-08-01T05:08:24.993"}, "6894392": {"ParentId": "6894370", "CommentCount": "0", "Body": "<p>-&gt; means MyClass is a pointer to the class and said pointer needs to be dereferenced in order to get to member m_Integer</p>\n<p>:: is the scope or namespace operator.
