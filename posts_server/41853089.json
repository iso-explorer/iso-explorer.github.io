Similarly a user defined container intended for use with <code>std::</code> algorithms can do that. Then when a template asks for <code>Container::iterator</code> the type it gets back <em>in that instantiation</em> is <code>T*</code>, and that behaves properly.</p>\n<p>So the standard requires that <code>vector</code> has a definition for <code>vector::iterator</code>, and you use that in your code. On one platform it is implemented as a pointer into an array, but on a different platform it is something else. Importantly these things behave the same way in all the aspects that the standard specifies.</p>\n", "LastActivityDate": "2017-01-25T14:16:54.403"}, "41853472": {"ParentId": "41853089", "PostTypeId": "2", "CommentCount": "3", "CreationDate": "2017-01-25T13:56:55.613", "Score": "2", "LastEditorUserId": "1317944", "LastEditDate": "2017-01-25T14:11:48.057", "Id": "41853472", "OwnerUserId": "1317944", "Body": "<p>My 50 cents:</p>\n<p>Iterators are generic ways to access <em>any</em> STL container. What I feel you're saying is: Since pointers are OK as a replacement of iterators for vectors, why are there iterators for vectors?</p>\n<p>Well, who said you can't have duplicates in C++? Actually it's a good thing to have different interfaces to the same functionality. That should not be a problem.</p>\n<p>On the other hand, think about libraries that have algorithms that use iterators. If vectors don't have iterators, it's just an invitation to exceptions (exceptions in the linguistic since, not programming sense). Every time one has to write an algorithm, he must do something different for vectors with pointers. But why? No reason for this hassle. Just interface everything the same way.</p>\n", "LastActivityDate": "2017-01-25T14:11:48.057"}, "41853089": {"CommentCount": "5", "AcceptedAnswerId": "41853537", "PostTypeId": "1", "LastEditorUserId": "-1", "CreationDate": "2017-01-25T13:38:10.610", "LastActivityDate": "2017-01-25T14:16:54.403", "LastEditDate": "2017-05-23T12:16:46.737", "ViewCount": "132", "FavoriteCount": "1", "Title": "Does Using a Pointer as a Container Iterator Violate the Standard", "Id": "41853089", "Score": "6", "Body": "<p><a href=\"https://stackoverflow.com/questions/41851547/how-to-adjust-vector-iterator-to-return-struct/41851678?noredirect=1#comment70888064_41851678\">Angew made a comment</a> that a <code>vector</code> using a raw pointer as it's iterator type was fine.
