However, the code could also fail as ambiguous according to the standard.</p>\n<p>If you look at 11.2p5 it has a relevant note (yes, I know notes are non-normative):</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p id=\"so_15398558_15421410_0\">[ Note: This class can be explicit, e.g., when a qualified-id is used,\n  or implicit, e.g., when a class member access operator (5.2.5) is used\n  (including cases where an implicit \u201cthis-&gt;\u201d is added). <strong>If both a class\n  member access operator and a qualified-id are used to name the member\n  (as in <code>p-&gt;T::m</code>), the class naming the member is the class denoted by\n  the nested-name-specifier of the qualified-id (that is, T)</strong>. \u2014end note\n  ]</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>What this note means, is that if you add <code>this-&gt;</code> to <code>C::x = 2;</code> then <code>C</code> is the class naming the member and <a href=\"http://liveworkspace.org/code/F2wWf%240\" rel=\"nofollow\">gcc 4.7.2 correctly fails when this is the case</a>.</p>\n<p>Now the question is <strong>Who is the class naming the member for</strong> <code>C::x</code>?\nThe <code>naming class</code> is specified by the same <code>11.2p5</code>:</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p id=\"so_15398558_15421410_1\">The access to a member is affected by the class in which the member is\n  named. <strong>This naming class is the class in which the member name was\n  looked up and found.</strong></p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>Now, name lookup for class members is specified in 10.2, and after reading all of it, I have concluded that <code>x</code> is the <strong>union</strong> of subobject sets as per:</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p id=\"so_15398558_15421410_2\">Otherwise, the new S(f, C) is a lookup set with the shared set of\n  declarations and the union of the subobject sets.</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>Which means that according to member lookup rules <code>x</code> can be either from <code>B</code> <em>or</em> <code>A</code>! This makes the code ill-formed as: <code>Name\nlookup can result in an ambiguity, in which case the program is ill-formed.</code>\nHowever, this ambiguity <strong>can</strong> be resolved as per 10.2p8:</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p id=\"so_15398558_15421410_3\">Ambiguities can often be resolved by qualifying a name with its class\n  name.</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>And from the <a href=\"https://llvm.org/viewvc/llvm-project/cfe/trunk/lib/Sema/SemaExpr.cpp?sortby=rev&amp;r1=97677&amp;r2=97676&amp;pathrev=97677\" rel=\"nofollow\">Clang source</a>, we can see that is what they chose to do:</p>\n<pre><code>// If the member was a qualified name and the qualified referred to a\n// specific base subobject type, we'll cast to that intermediate type\n// first and then to the object in which the member is declared. That allows\n// one to resolve ambiguities in, e.g., a diamond-shaped hierarchy such as:\n//\n//   class Base { public: int x; };\n//   class Derived1 : public Base { };\n//   class Derived2 : public Base { };\n//   class VeryDerived : public Derived1, public Derived2 { void f(); };\n//   void VeryDerived::f() {\n//     x = 17; // error: ambiguous base subobjects\n//     Derived1::x = 17; // okay, pick the Base subobject of Derived1\n//   }\n</code></pre>\n<p>However, note the <code>can</code> in the wording of the above quote: <code>often can be resolved</code>. This means that <strong>they do not necessarily have to be resolved</strong>. So, I think according to the standard the code should fail as ambiguous or as a private member access failure.</p>\n<p><strong>EDIT</strong></p>\n<p>There is some contention about the interpretation of <code>can</code> and as to whether a ambiguity occurs here.
