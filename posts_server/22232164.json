Lambdas in template parameters</a> which seeks to clarify this restriction and states the intention of the restriction in section <code>5.1.2</code> was to:</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p id=\"so_22232164_22232165_0\">[...] avert the need to deal with them in function template signatures [...]</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>As the issue documents the current wording actually has a hole since <em>costant expressions</em> allows them in an unevaluated context. But it does not outright state the rationale for this restriction. The desire to avoid name mangling stands out and you can infer that avoiding extending <em>SFINAE</em> was also desired since the proposed resolution seeks to tighten the restriction even though several viable alternatives would have allowed <em>SFINAE</em>. The modified version of <code>5.1.2</code> paragraph <em>2</em> as follows:</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p id=\"so_22232164_22232165_1\">A lambda-expression shall not appear in an unevaluated operand (Clause 5 [expr]), <strong>in a template-argument, in an alias-declaration, in a typedef declaration, or in the declaration of a function or function template outside its function body and default arguments [Note: The intention is to prevent lambdas from appearing in a signature \u2014end note]</strong>. [Note: A closure object behaves like a function object (20.10 [function.objects]). \u2014end note] </p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>This proposal was accepted and is in <code>N3936</code>(<em><a href=\"https://stackoverflow.com/a/4653479/1708801\">see this answer for a link</a></em>)</p>\n<p>For a more explicit discussion of the rationale to avoid having lambdas as an <em>unevaluated operand</em>.
