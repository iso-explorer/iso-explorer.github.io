That, incidentally, is true for all functions.</p>\n<p>If programs in the build chain (compiler, linker, etc) can detect that any symbol (e.g. static or non-static member function) is not being used, it can safely remove them.</p>\n<p>The harder practical problem is probably detecting that a non-static member function is not being called.   Even more so, if it is virtual, since the static type of an object is what determines which override of a virtual function is called.   Detecting such cases is not impossible in principle, but would require a fair amount of analysis.</p>\n<p>In the end it will come down to quality of implementation of the build chain, since the standard requires nothing in particular.   That comes down to whether the vendor chooses to implement such optimisations.   And, since this is not a behaviour that many developers actually seek (the most likely people to seek it will have a premature optimisation fetish) not many would.</p>\n", "LastActivityDate": "2016-02-26T10:33:11.570", "CommentCount": "0", "CreationDate": "2016-02-26T10:33:11.570", "ParentId": "35648348", "Score": "2", "OwnerUserId": "4706785"}, "bq_ids": {"n4140": {"so_35648348_35654696_1": {"length": 22, "quality": 0.9166666666666666, "section_id": 5797}, "so_35648348_35654696_0": {"length": 10, "quality": 1.0, "section_id": 5797}}, "n3337": {"so_35648348_35654696_1": {"length": 22, "quality": 0.9166666666666666, "section_id": 5570}, "so_35648348_35654696_0": {"length": 10, "quality": 1.0, "section_id": 5570}}, "n4659": {"so_35648348_35654696_1": {"length": 22, "quality": 0.9166666666666666, "section_id": 7256}, "so_35648348_35654696_0": {"length": 10, "quality": 1.0, "section_id": 7256}}}, "35648786": {"Id": "35648786", "PostTypeId": "2", "Body": "<p>Yes.  </p>\n<p>If the method is unused, then there is no way to tell it has been removed - so a linker can do so.
