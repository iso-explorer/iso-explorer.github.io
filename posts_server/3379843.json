This is also true with a C99 program. Whether return 0 should be omitted or not is open to debate.</p>\n</blockquote>\n", "CreationDate": "2010-07-31T21:28:00.907", "ParentId": "3379843", "CommentCount": "0", "LastEditDate": "2017-05-23T12:11:30.900", "Id": "3379853", "PostTypeId": "2", "LastActivityDate": "2010-07-31T21:28:00.907", "LastEditorUserId": "-1", "CommunityOwnedDate": "2010-07-31T21:28:00.907", "Score": "1", "OwnerUserId": "276101"}});
