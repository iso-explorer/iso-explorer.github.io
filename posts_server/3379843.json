This is also true with a C99 program. Whether return 0 should be omitted or not is open to debate.</p>\n</blockquote>\n", "OwnerUserId": "276101"}, "bq_ids": {"n4140": {"so_3379843_3379857_0": {"section_id": 7149, "quality": 0.9259259259259259, "length": 25}}, "n3337": {"so_3379843_3379857_0": {"section_id": 6893, "quality": 0.9259259259259259, "length": 25}}, "n4659": {"so_3379843_3379857_0": {"section_id": 8650, "quality": 0.7777777777777778, "length": 21}}}});
