Think about it - how is the compiler processing main.cpp supposed to know that, in a different source file, you gave default arguments to some parameters?</p>\n<p>Formally, default arguments are specific to any given scope:</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p id=\"so_27594710_27594839_0\"><strong>8.3.6/4</strong> For non-template functions, default arguments can be added in later declarations of a function in the same scope. Declarations in\n  different scopes have completely distinct sets of default arguments...</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>Even in the same source file, you can declare the same function to have different default arguments in different scopes. The compiler would happily substitute whatever default arguments, if any, are specified by the declaration visible in the current scope.</p>\n<hr>\n<p>On an unrelated note, the word \"linkage\" is a term of art - it has a very specific meaning in C++. This notion of linkage is largely irrelevant to your question, at least insofar as it relates to default arguments (I just point it out for the benefit of readers who might be confused by the question's title). The set of default arguments is not part of the function name or signature, and doesn't affect its linkage, its ability to be used across scopes and translation units.</p>\n</hr>", "OwnerUserId": "1670129", "LastEditorUserId": "1670129", "LastEditDate": "2014-12-21T23:37:55.413", "Id": "27594839", "Score": "3", "CreationDate": "2014-12-21T23:22:50.247", "LastActivityDate": "2014-12-21T23:37:55.413"}});
