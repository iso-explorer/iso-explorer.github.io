An implicitly-declared default constructor is an <code>inline public</code> member of its class.</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>I don't see anything in the standard that answers the other two questions.

If there is no user-declared constructor\n  for class X, a non-explicit constructor having no parameters is implicitly declared as defaulted (8.4).\n  An implicitly-declared default constructor is an inline public member of its class. A defaulted default\n  constructor for class X is defined as deleted if:</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>Several bullet points follow, none of which apply. So we have the equivalent of:</p>\n<pre><code>My_Interface() = default;\n</code></pre>\n<p>Then, from [class.copy]:</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p id=\"so_31571202_31571496_2\">If the class definition does not explicitly declare a copy constructor, a non-explicit one is declared implicitly. If the class definition declares a move constructor or move assignment operator, the implicitly declared copy\n  constructor is defined as deleted; otherwise, it is defined as defaulted (8.4).</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>So we have:</p>\n<pre><code>My_Interface(const My_Interface&amp;) = default;\n</code></pre>\n<p>Also:</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p id=\"so_31571202_31571496_3\">If the definition of a class X does not explicitly declare a move constructor, a non-explicit one will be implicitly\n  declared as defaulted if and only if<br>\n  (9.1) \u2014 X does not have a user-declared copy constructor,<br>\n  (9.2) \u2014 X does not have a user-declared copy assignment operator,<br>\n  (9.3) \u2014 X does not have a user-declared move assignment operator, and<br>\n  (9.4) \u2014 X does not have a user-declared destructor.</br></br></br></br></p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>So we also have:</p>\n<pre><code>My_Interface(My_Interface&amp;&amp; ) = default;\n</code></pre>\n<blockquote id=\"so_31571202_31571496_4\">\n<ol start=\"2\">\n<li>If a constructor is generated, what would it's content be?</li>\n</ol>\n</blockquote>\n<p>All three are generated, all three are <code>= default;</code></p>\n<blockquote id=\"so_31571202_31571496_5\">\n<ol start=\"3\">\n<li>If a constructor is generated, would it be eliminated by an optimization level?</li>\n</ol>\n</blockquote>\n<p>None of the three constructors are <em>trivial</em> because <code>My_Interface</code> has a virtual function.
