This prevents slicing of the exception object in the case that it is derived. This is not specific to exceptions but a general feature of inheritance. </p>\n<p>A description of this phenomena is discussed <a href=\"https://stackoverflow.com/questions/2522299/c-catch-blocks-catch-exception-by-value-or-reference\">here</a></p>\n<p>Also, as pointed out by another answer, if you insist on doing things this way you need to change the order of catches, as a derived class satisfies the base catch block. There is another way of doing this though that uses this property explicitly: Just have the base class catch everything. You can use this unless there is a very specific feature of the derived exception that needs to be treated separately</p>\n", "LastEditorUserId": "-1", "LastActivityDate": "2017-01-08T13:26:17.393", "Score": "3", "CreationDate": "2017-01-08T13:26:17.393", "ParentId": "41533111", "CommentCount": "0", "OwnerUserId": "3684792", "LastEditDate": "2017-05-23T10:29:17.767"}});
