The operand is either an expression, which is an unevaluated operand (Clause 5), or a parenthesized <em>type-id</em>. <strong>The <code>sizeof</code> operator shall not be applied to an expression that has function or incomplete type</strong>, to an enumeration type whose underlying type is not fixed before all its enumerators have been declared, to the parenthesized name of such types, or to an lvalue that designates a bit-field. <code>sizeof(char)</code>, <code>sizeof(signed char)</code> and <code>sizeof(unsigned char)</code> are <code>1</code>. The result of <code>sizeof</code> applied to any other fundamental type (3.9.1) is implementation-defined. <em>[..]</em></p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>It simply doesn't make sense; <code>sizeof</code> measures the space taken up in memory by a piece of data: a variable or a constant, with a value that you can read. But a function is not a piece of data, and it has no size.</p>\n<p>The amount of memory taken by the program code itself, although the program <em>is</em> loaded into memory at runtime, is never considered by any language features within the program.</p>\n<p>The fact that a function has a type is not relevant!
