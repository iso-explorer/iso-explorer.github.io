Order not defined (as per standard). But all implementations of C/C++ (that I know of) evaluate function arguments from <strong>right to left</strong>.  <em>EDIT: CLang is an exception (see comment below).</em></p>\n<p>I believe that the right-to-left evaluation order has been very very old (since the first C compilers). Certainly way before C++ was invented, and most implementations of C++ would be keeping the same evaluation order because early C++ implementations simply translated into C. </p>\n<p>There are some technical reasons for evaluating function arguments right-to-left. In stack architectures, arguments are typically pushed onto the stack. In C/C++, you can call a function with more arguments than actually specified -- the extra arguments are simiply ignored. If arguments are evaluated left-to-right, and pushed left-to-right, then the stack slot right under the stack pointer will hold the last argument, and there is no way for the function to get at the offset of any particular argument (because the actual number of arguments pushed depends on the caller).</p>\n<p>In a right-to-left push order, the stack slot right under the stack pointer will always hold the first argument, and the next slot holds the second argument etc. Argument offsets will always be deterministic for the function (which may be written and compiled elsewhere into a library, separately from where it is called).</p>\n<p>Now, right-to-left push order does not mandate right-to-left evaluation order, but in early compilers, memory is scarce. In right-to-left evaluation order, the same stack can be used in-place (essentially, after evaluating the argument -- which may be an expression or a funciton call! -- the return value is already at the right position on the stack). In left-to-right evaluation, the argument values must be stored separately and the pushed back to the stack in reverse order.</p>\n", "LastEditorUserId": "650891", "LastActivityDate": "2015-09-16T02:34:20.187", "Score": "3", "CreationDate": "2011-03-22T12:10:50.000", "ParentId": "621542", "CommentCount": "1", "OwnerUserId": "650891", "LastEditDate": "2015-09-16T02:34:20.187"}, "621554": {"Id": "621554", "PostTypeId": "2", "Body": "<p>Last time I saw differences was between VS2005 and GCC 3.x on an x86 hardware in 2007.\nSo it's (was?) a very likely situation.
