You should read the <code>assert</code> line as:</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p id=\"so_33908007_33908091_0\">Assert that <code>a</code> doesn't equal five.</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>In other words, if it <em>does</em> equal five, your assertion has failed and an error is raised.</p>\n<p>For example, from the C11 standard<sup>(a)</sup>, <code>7.2.1.1 The assert macro /2</code> (my emphasis):</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p id=\"so_33908007_33908091_1\">The <code>assert</code> macro puts diagnostic tests into programs; it expands to a void expression. When it is executed, if expression (which shall have a scalar type) is false (that is, compares equal to 0), the <code>assert</code> macro writes information about the particular call that failed (including the text of the argument, the name of the source file, the source line number, and the name of the enclosing function - the latter are respectively the values of the preprocessing macros <code>__FILE__</code> and <code>__LINE__</code> and of the identifier <code>__func__</code>) on the standard error stream in an implementation-defined format.</p>\n<p id=\"so_33908007_33908091_2\"><strong><em>It then calls the <code>abort</code> function.</em></strong></p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>I'm not actually a big fan of assertions myself in most cases, for the following reasons.</p>\n<p>First, assertions tend to only be enabled for debug code because it's the <code>NDEBUG</code> preprocessor macro that controls it and this is often set differently between debug and release code. Hence, assertions tend to be limited in usefulness only during development.</p>\n<p>Secondly, even if it <em>does</em> assert in release code, the effects of the assertion are not something your users should be seeing. It would be preferable to fail gracefully rather than exit the program.</p>\n<p>They <em>are</em> somewhat useful during the development process but, any failed assertion during development should be an instant blocker to releasing the code into production until you've put in some more decent error handling for it.</p>\n<p>That's because the assertion either won't be tested in release code (and results will likely be catastrophic) or you'll have assertions on in the release code (and your program will summarily abort. That's going to result in some fairly frank discussions with your customers :-)</p>\n<hr>\n<p><sup>(a)</sup> Yes, I <em>know</em> this is a C++ question but C++ mostly defers to C with the heritage headers such as <code>cassert</code>.
