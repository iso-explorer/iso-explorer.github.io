This might seem like a very simple issue, but there are some complexities to contend with.</p>\n<p>The first idea to consider is the notion of a \"basic source character set\" in C++. This is defined to be:</p>\n<pre><code>    all ASCII printing characters 041 - 0177, save for @ $ ` DEL\n\n    space\n\n    horizontal tab\n\n    vertical tab\n\n    form feed\n\n    newline\n</code></pre>\n<p>or 96 characters in all. These are the characters used to compose a C++ source program.</p>\n<p>Some national character sets, such as the European ISO-646 one, use some of these character positions for other letters. The ASCII characters so affected are:</p>\n<pre><code>    [ ] { } | \\\n</code></pre>\n<p>To get around this problem, C++ defines trigraph sequences that can be used to represent these characters:</p>\n<pre><code>    [       ??(\n\n    ]       ??)\n\n    {       ??&lt;\n\n    }       ??&gt;\n\n    |       ??!\n\n    \\       ??/\n\n    #       ??=\n\n    ^       ??'\n\n    ~       ??-\n</code></pre>\n<p>Trigraph sequences are mapped to the corresponding basic source character early in the compilation process.</p>\n<p>C++ also has the notion of \"alternative tokens\", that can be used to replace tokens with others. The list of tokens and their alternatives is this:</p>\n<pre><code>    {       &lt;%\n\n    }       %&gt;\n\n    [       &lt;:\n\n    ]       :&gt;\n\n    #       %:\n\n    ##      %:%:\n\n    &amp;&amp;      and\n\n    |       bitor\n\n    ||      or\n\n    ^       xor\n\n    ~       compl\n\n    &amp;       bitand\n\n    &amp;=      and_eq\n\n    |=      or_eq\n\n    ^=      xor_eq\n\n    !       not\n\n    !=      not_eq\n</code></pre>\n<p>Another idea is the \"basic execution character set\". This includes all of the basic source character set, plus control characters for alert, backspace, carriage return, and null. The \"execution character set\" is the basic execution character set plus additional implementation-defined characters. The idea is that a source character set is used to define a C++ program itself, while an execution character set is used when a C++ application is executing.</p>\n<p>Given this notion, it's possible to manipulate additional characters in a running program, for example characters from Cyrillic or Greek. Character constants can be expressed using any of:</p>\n<pre><code>    \\137            octal\n\n    \\xabcd          hexadecimal\n\n    \\u12345678      universal character name (ISO/IEC 10646)\n\n    \\u1234          -&gt; \\u00001234\n</code></pre>\n<p>This notation uses the source character set to define execution set characters. Universal character names can be used in identifiers (if letters) and in character literals:</p>\n<pre><code>    '\\u1234'\n\n    L'\\u2345'\n</code></pre>\n<p>The above features may not yet exist in your local C++ compiler. They are important to consider when developing internationalized applications. </p>\n", "LastActivityDate": "2011-08-16T16:17:30.923", "CommentCount": "4", "CreationDate": "2011-08-16T16:17:30.923", "ParentId": "7081367", "Score": "0", "OwnerUserId": "2095507"}, "7081402": {"Id": "7081402", "PostTypeId": "2", "Body": "<p><code>\\u00b1</code> is the <code>\u00b1</code> symbol as that is the correct unicode representation regardless of locale.</p>\n<p>Your code at <a href=\"http://ideone.com/6suGj\" rel=\"nofollow\">ideone, see here</a>.</p>\n", "OwnerDisplayName": "user195488", "LastActivityDate": "2011-08-16T16:16:31.060", "Score": "1", "CreationDate": "2011-08-16T16:16:31.060", "ParentId": "7081367", "CommentCount": "0"}, "7081484": {"Id": "7081484", "PostTypeId": "2", "Body": "<blockquote>\n<p id=\"so_7081367_7081484_0\">2.13.2.
