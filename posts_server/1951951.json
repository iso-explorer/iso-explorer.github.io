This is explained under 16.2.2 [cpp.include]:</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p id=\"so_1951951_37228442_1\">A preprocessing directive of the form<br>\n<code># include &lt; h-char-sequence&gt; new-line</code><br>\n  searches a sequence of implementation-defined places for a header identified uniquely by the specified sequence between the <code>&lt;</code> and <code>&gt;</code> delimiters, and causes the replacement of that directive by the entire contents of the header. <strong>How the places are specified or the header identified is implementation-defined.</strong></br></br></p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>Similarly, 16.2.3 [cpp.include]:</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p id=\"so_1951951_37228442_2\">A preprocessing directive of the form<br>\n<code># include \" q-char-sequence\" new-line</code><br>\n  causes the replacement of that directive by the entire contents of the source file identified by the specified sequence between the <code>\"</code> delimiters. <strong>The named source file is searched for in an implementation-defined manner.</strong> If this search is not supported, or if the search fails, the directive is reprocessed as if it read<br>\n<code># include &lt; h-char-sequence&gt; new-line</code><br>\n  with the identical contained sequence (including <code>&gt;</code> characters, if any) from the original directive.</br></br></br></br></p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>A natural choice for an implementation of the language is to use the case sensitivity of the filesystem or OS, but there is no strict requirement to do so (as all other answers suggest).</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p id=\"so_1951951_37228442_3\"><em>What's the best practice, keep all file/folder names lowercase and thus do the same when including?</em></p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>Best practice, as always: Keep things consistent. If you are using mixed-case source/header files in your project, keep using them and replicate the exact casing in your <code>#include</code> directives.</p>\n", "LastActivityDate": "2016-05-14T15:24:39.967", "CommentCount": "0", "CreationDate": "2016-05-14T15:24:39.967", "ParentId": "1951951", "Score": "0", "OwnerUserId": "1889329"}, "1951969": {"Id": "1951969", "PostTypeId": "2", "Body": "<p>The case sensitivity depends on the Operating System.
