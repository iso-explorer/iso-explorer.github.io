This oversight was remedied by  <a href=\"http://www.open-std.org/jtc1/sc22/wg21/docs/papers/2014/n4164.pdf\">N4164</a>, which added the following definition to <a href=\"http://eel.is/c++draft/temp.deduct#call-3\">[temp.deduct]</a>:</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p id=\"so_39552272_39552345_1\">A <em>forwarding reference</em> is an rvalue reference to a cv-unqualified template parameter. If <code>P</code> is a forwarding reference and the argument is an lvalue, the type \u201clvalue reference to A\u201d is used in place of A for type deduction.</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>Hence, the two mean the same thing, and the current C++ standard term is forwarding reference. The paper itself articulates why \"forwarding reference\" is a better term than \"universal reference.\"</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p id=\"so_39552272_39552345_2\">Is it only a forwarding reference if the function body calls <code>std::forward</code>?</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>Nope, what you do with a forwarding reference is irrelevant to the name. The concept forwarding reference simply refers to how the type <code>T</code> is deduced in:</p>\n<pre><code>template &lt;class T&gt; void foo(T&amp;&amp; ); // &lt;== \n</code></pre>\n<p>It does not need to be subsequently forwarded .</p>\n", "LastActivityDate": "2016-09-17T22:41:14.160"}, "bq_ids": {"n4140": {"so_39552272_39552345_1": {"section_id": 304, "quality": 0.8235294117647058, "length": 14}}, "n3337": {"so_39552272_39552345_1": {"section_id": 295, "quality": 0.8235294117647058, "length": 14}}, "n4659": {"so_39552272_39552345_1": {"section_id": 311, "quality": 0.9411764705882353, "length": 16}}}, "39552328": {"ParentId": "39552272", "CommentCount": "0", "CreationDate": "2016-09-17T22:32:19.993", "OwnerUserId": "4987285", "PostTypeId": "2", "Id": "39552328", "Score": "8", "Body": "<p>Unfortunately, it's confusing, but they are nothing more than two names for the same thing.<br>\nUniversal reference was proposed (I guess) by Meyers far ago (see <a href=\"https://isocpp.org/blog/2012/11/universal-references-in-c11-scott-meyers\">here</a> as an example).<br>\nForwarding reference is picked up directly from the <em>standardese</em>.
