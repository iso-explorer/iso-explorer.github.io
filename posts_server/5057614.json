Essentially, what it comes down to is that the result of a pointer-to-pointer <code>reinterpret_cast</code> operation can't safely be used for <em>anything</em> other than being cast back to the original pointer type.</p>\n<p>In practice, however, most real-world uses of <code>reinterpret_cast</code> seem to be based on the (wrong) assumption that a <code>reinterpret_cast</code> is the same as a C-style cast.  For example, I've seen lots of code which uses <code>reinterpret_cast</code> to cast from <code>char*</code> to <code>unsigned char*</code> for the purpose of character set conversion routines.  This is completely harmless, yet strictly speaking it's not portable - there's no guarantee that a <code>reinterpret_cast</code> from <code>char*</code> to <code>unsigned char*</code> won't crash your program when you try to dereference the <code>unsigned char*</code> pointer.</p>\n<p>It's seems the <em>only</em> other real use of <code>reinterpret_cast</code> that has any real guarantees, according to the standard, is converting from pointer to integer, and vice-versa.  </p>\n<p>And yet there are many cases where we'd <em>want</em> (and should be able to) safely convert between different pointer types.  For example: <code>uint16_t*</code> to the new C++0x <code>char16_t*</code>, or really any pointer to a basic data type that is the same size/alignment as the original type.  Yet <code>reinterpret_cast</code> provides no guarantees this should work.  </p>\n<p><strong>Question:</strong> How can we safely convert between pointers to basic data-types of the same size/alignment, such as <code>char*</code> --&gt; <code>unsigned char*</code>?  Since <code>reinterpret_cast</code> doesn't seem to guarantee this actually works, are C-style casts the only safe option here?</p>\n", "AcceptedAnswerId": "5064073", "Title": "Is reinterpret_cast mostly useless?", "CreationDate": "2011-02-20T14:32:18.907", "Id": "5057614", "CommentCount": "10", "FavoriteCount": "4", "PostTypeId": "1", "LastEditDate": "2017-05-23T11:45:49.150", "LastEditorUserId": "-1", "LastActivityDate": "2012-11-04T16:38:26.157", "Score": "16", "OwnerUserId": "469408", "Tags": "<c++><pointers><casting><reinterpret-cast><type-punning>", "AnswerCount": "5"}, "bq_ids": {"n4140": {"so_5057614_8465952_1": {"length": 14, "quality": 0.7368421052631579, "section_id": 6046}, "so_5057614_8465952_2": {"length": 45, "quality": 0.9782608695652174, "section_id": 6039}, "so_5057614_8465952_5": {"length": 13, "quality": 0.6190476190476191, "section_id": 6046}}, "n3337": {"so_5057614_8465952_1": {"length": 17, "quality": 0.8947368421052632, "section_id": 5814}, "so_5057614_8465952_2": {"length": 45, "quality": 0.9782608695652174, "section_id": 5807}, "so_5057614_8465952_3": {"length": 19, "quality": 1.0, "section_id": 5650}, "so_5057614_8465952_5": {"length": 16, "quality": 0.7619047619047619, "section_id": 5814}}, "n4659": {"so_5057614_8465952_1": {"length": 13, "quality": 0.6842105263157895, "section_id": 7545}, "so_5057614_8465952_2": {"length": 30, "quality": 0.6521739130434783, "section_id": 7536}, "so_5057614_8465952_5": {"length": 13, "quality": 0.6190476190476191, "section_id": 7545}}}});
