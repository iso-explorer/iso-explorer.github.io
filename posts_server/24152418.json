It also means that if you declare a constexpr function in a header, and then call it in a translation unit, even only at runtime, \"An inline function shall be defined in every translation unit in which it is odr-used.\" from C++14[basic.def.odr]p4.</p>\n<p>Note that the rules for constant expressions and calls in general are different: calls in general require the definition to be <em>somewhere</em> in the translation unit: constant expressions require the definition to be <em>before</em> the constant expression.</p>\n", "OwnerUserId": "943619", "PostTypeId": "2", "Id": "24361568", "Score": "3", "CreationDate": "2014-06-23T08:34:35.767", "LastActivityDate": "2014-06-23T08:34:35.767"}, "bq_ids": {"n4140": {"so_24152418_24361568_1": {"section_id": 5418, "quality": 0.8571428571428571, "length": 6}, "so_24152418_24361568_0": {"section_id": 6185, "quality": 0.9285714285714286, "length": 13}}, "n3337": {"so_24152418_24361568_1": {"section_id": 5213, "quality": 0.8571428571428571, "length": 6}}, "n4659": {"so_24152418_24361568_1": {"section_id": 6839, "quality": 0.5714285714285714, "length": 4}, "so_24152418_24361568_0": {"section_id": 7687, "quality": 0.7857142857142857, "length": 11}}}, "24152418": {"CommentCount": "4", "ViewCount": "1144", "CreationDate": "2014-06-10T23:24:33.987", "LastActivityDate": "2014-06-23T08:34:35.767", "Title": "Declaring constexpr functions or methods", "AcceptedAnswerId": "24361568", "PostTypeId": "1", "Id": "24152418", "Score": "8", "Body": "<p>I was wondering if there was any restrictions on where constexpr functions and methods have to be declared, like there are for inline functions and methods.</p>\n<p>I know that inline functions or methods must be written in header files, to give the compiler access to their definition where they are called.
