post_cb({"38210174": {"ViewCount": "132", "Body": "<p>Ok, so I was coding a C++ console app involving File - IO. In c++, to apply file io, you have the import one of three headers, them being <code>&lt;ifstream&gt;</code>,<code>&lt;ofstream&gt;</code>, and <code>&lt;fstream&gt;</code>. In Visual Studio Community 2015, at first when I wrote this code:</p>\n<pre><code>#include &lt;ifstream&gt;\nint main()\n{\n    std::ifstream inf(\"testingifstream.txt\");\n}\n</code></pre>\n<p>The first thing I noticed right away, is that the Intellisense gave me an error stating that it had an error opening ifstream, as it \"was not found\". After posting on a different forum, I got the solution to use the <code>&lt;fstream&gt;</code> header, since it has the classes for ifstream and ofstream, and then my code worked. But I only need the ifstream class, so I think it is unnecessary that I have to bring fstream in as well. This leads me to my question, are ifstream and ofstream non-standard headers for Windows Visual Studio, and is there any way I can include them?</p>\n", "AcceptedAnswerId": "38210199", "Title": "Are ifstream and ofstream non-standard c++ headers?", "CreationDate": "2016-07-05T18:24:37.433", "Id": "38210174", "CommentCount": "6", "FavoriteCount": "0", "PostTypeId": "1", "LastActivityDate": "2016-07-07T18:08:23.217", "Score": "2", "OwnerUserId": "6525260", "Tags": "<c++><visual-c++><ifstream><ofstream>", "AnswerCount": "2"}, "bq_ids": {"n4140": {"so_38210174_38210199_0": {"length": 5, "quality": 0.625, "section_id": 6257}}, "n3337": {"so_38210174_38210199_0": {"length": 5, "quality": 0.625, "section_id": 6017}}}, "38210843": {"PostTypeId": "2", "Body": "<p>The headers are nonstandard for windows.
