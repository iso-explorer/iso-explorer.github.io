The value of the first argument supplied to a deallocation function may be a null pointer value; if so, and if the deallocation function is one supplied in the standard library, the call has no effect. Otherwise, the value supplied\n  to operator <code>delete(void*)</code> in the standard library shall be one of the values returned by a previous invocation of either operator <code>new(std::size_t)</code> or <code>operator new(std::size_t, const std::nothrow_-t&amp;)</code> in the standard library, and the value supplied to operator <code>delete[](void*)</code> in the standard library shall be one of the values returned by a previous invocation of either <code>operator new[](std::size_t)</code> or\n  <code>operator new[](std::size_t, const std::nothrow_t&amp;)</code> in the standard library.</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>In C++ it is better to use <strong><a href=\"https://stackoverflow.com/questions/395123/raii-and-smart-pointers-in-c\">RAII(SBRM)</a></strong> by using <strong>Smart pointers</strong> instead of raw pointers, which automatically take care of the memory deallocations.</p>\n", "LastEditorUserId": "-1", "LastActivityDate": "2011-09-17T06:00:34.540", "CommentCount": "0", "CreationDate": "2011-07-31T17:04:52.187", "ParentId": "6890883", "Score": "9", "OwnerUserId": "452307", "LastEditDate": "2017-05-23T09:58:56.150"}, "6890901": {"PostTypeId": "2", "Body": "<p>Because you have to pass the <em>unaltered</em> result of new to delete.
