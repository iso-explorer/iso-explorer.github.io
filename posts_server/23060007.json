But what about the next case, i.e., where the friend function is <strong>not</strong> defined in the class granting friendship? What is this, so called lookup in namespace function definition? Would that be paragraph 6? I'm not sure.</p>\n", "Tags": "<c++><c++11><lookup><language-lawyer>", "OwnerUserId": "2548699", "AnswerCount": "1"}, "bq_ids": {"n4140": {"so_23060007_23060119_0": {"section_id": 7092, "quality": 1.0, "length": 8}, "so_23060007_23060007_0": {"section_id": 7095, "quality": 0.9722222222222222, "length": 35}}, "n3337": {"so_23060007_23060119_0": {"section_id": 6836, "quality": 1.0, "length": 8}, "so_23060007_23060007_0": {"section_id": 6839, "quality": 0.9722222222222222, "length": 35}}, "n4659": {"so_23060007_23060119_0": {"section_id": 8594, "quality": 0.75, "length": 6}, "so_23060007_23060007_0": {"section_id": 8596, "quality": 0.9722222222222222, "length": 35}}}});
