So I am creating a map with the static keyword in a header file and then saving entries to it in the source file. I tested the map in the source file and it saved the entries successfully. However, when I call the map in the main.cpp file to print out the entries, the map is empty. Can anyone help me with a way so that the map retains the entries when it's called in main?</p>\n<p>I thought by making it static that the entries would remain in the map until the end of the program but it seems otherwise and I don't know another way.
