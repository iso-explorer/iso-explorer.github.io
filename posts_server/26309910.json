The answer doesn't address whether or not GCC is wrong in not providing a diagnostic, only giving a warning flag that's somewhat a substitute.</p>\n<p>The relevant sections of the standard:</p>\n<p>\u00a7 14.3.2/5</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p id=\"so_26309910_26309910_0\">For a non-type template-parameter of integral or enumeration type,\n  conversions permitted in a con- verted constant expression (5.19) are\n  applied.</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>\u00a7 5.19/3</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p id=\"so_26309910_26309910_1\">A converted constant expression of type T is a literal constant\n  expression, implicitly converted to type T, where the implicit\n  conversion (if any) is permitted in a literal constant expression and\n  the implicit conversion sequence contains only user-defined\n  conversions, lvalue-to-rvalue conversions (4.1), integral promotions\n  (4.5), and integral conversions (4.7) other than narrowing conversions\n  (8.5.4)</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>The standard addresses situations in which narrowing conversions will make a program ill-formed, but there is a glaring omission here, so compilers disagree (GCC provides no diagnostic, Clang makes this an error, MSVC also provides no diagnostic.) Is there language in the standard that says for this situation, a diagnostic is required (i.e. it's ill-formed)? </p>\n<pre><code>#include &lt;array&gt;\n\nint main()\n{\n    std::array&lt;int, -1&gt; a;\n}\n</code></pre>\n", "Tags": "<c++><c++11><language-lawyer>", "AnswerCount": "1"}, "26310017": {"ParentId": "26309910", "CommentCount": "0", "Body": "<p>As of n3337, the wording had already been changed to make it clear that the result is ill-formed.
