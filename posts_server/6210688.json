The code:</p>\n<pre><code>assert( v.size() &gt; 0 );\nv.push_back( v[0] );\n</code></pre>\n<p>Is guaranteed to be correct by the standard (C++03) through the exception guarantees (which are a really good reason not to implement your own containers, you will probably not get them right).

Because in general copy constructors <em>can</em> throw, the implementation must ensure that all copies are performed before destroying any object.</p>\n<p>This becomes more evident in C++0x, when objects are not copied from one location to another, but rather <em>moved</em>. Because the copy of the new element might throw, it has to be performed <em>before</em> any of the moves are executed, or else you would be left in a situation where some of the objects in the original container have been invalidated.</p>\n", "LastEditorUserId": "36565", "LastActivityDate": "2011-10-03T11:21:37.047", "Score": "5", "CreationDate": "2011-06-02T08:29:48.773", "ParentId": "6210688", "CommentCount": "9", "LastEditDate": "2011-10-03T11:21:37.047", "OwnerUserId": "36565"}, "6210726": {"Id": "6210726", "PostTypeId": "2", "Body": "<p>I guess this would be safe:</p>\n<pre><code>std::vector&lt;int&gt; a(1);\na.push_back(1);\na.push_back(int(a[0]));\n</code></pre>\n", "LastActivityDate": "2011-06-02T05:18:28.747", "Score": "4", "CreationDate": "2011-06-02T05:18:28.747", "ParentId": "6210688", "CommentCount": "5", "OwnerUserId": "103167"}});
