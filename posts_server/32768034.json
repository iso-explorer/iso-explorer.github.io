If you do click on the link of <a href=\"http://en.cppreference.com/w/cpp/language/declarations\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">block declarations</a> It will bring you to a list of declarations and in that it has <a href=\"http://en.cppreference.com/w/cpp/language/templates\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">Template declaration</a> and in there it has</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p id=\"so_32768034_32768225_2\">declaration of a class (including struct and union), a member class or member enumeration type, a function or member function, a static data member at namespace scope, a variable or static data member at class scope, (since C++14) or an alias template (since C++11) It may also define a template specialization.</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>As for why the standard says that templates can only be declared in namespace scope or class scope I like <a href=\"https://stackoverflow.com/users/649665/james-kanze\">James Kanze</a> <a href=\"https://stackoverflow.com/a/6032668/4342498\">answer</a></p>\n<blockquote>\n<p id=\"so_32768034_32768225_3\">The problem is probably linked to the historical way templates were implemented: early implementation techniques (and some still used today) require all symbols in a template to have external linkage. (Instantiation is done by generating the equivalent code in a separate file.) And names defined inside a function never have linkage, and cannot be referred to outside of the scope in which they were defined.</p>\n</blockquote>\n", "OwnerUserId": "4342498", "LastEditorUserId": "-1", "LastEditDate": "2017-05-23T10:27:21.520", "Id": "32768225", "Score": "5", "CreationDate": "2015-09-24T18:15:33.760", "LastActivityDate": "2015-09-24T19:53:01.107"}, "bq_ids": {"n4140": {"so_32768034_32768225_1": {"section_id": 49, "quality": 1.0, "length": 15}, "so_32768034_32768223_0": {"section_id": 49, "quality": 1.0, "length": 8}, "so_32768034_32768225_0": {"section_id": 165, "quality": 0.8888888888888888, "length": 16}}, "n3337": {"so_32768034_32768225_1": {"section_id": 44, "quality": 1.0, "length": 15}, "so_32768034_32768223_0": {"section_id": 44, "quality": 1.0, "length": 8}, "so_32768034_32768225_0": {"section_id": 159, "quality": 0.8888888888888888, "length": 16}}, "n4659": {"so_32768034_32768225_0": {"section_id": 169, "quality": 0.8888888888888888, "length": 16}, "so_32768034_32768223_0": {"section_id": 50, "quality": 1.0, "length": 8}, "so_32768034_32768225_1": {"section_id": 50, "quality": 1.0, "length": 15}}}, "32768034": {"CommentCount": "1", "ViewCount": "270", "CreationDate": "2015-09-24T18:03:50.193", "LastActivityDate": "2015-09-24T19:53:01.107", "Title": "Template alias scope", "PostTypeId": "1", "Id": "32768034", "Score": "1", "Body": "<p>As per <a href=\"http://en.cppreference.com/w/cpp/language/type_alias\" rel=\"nofollow\">http://en.cppreference.com/w/cpp/language/type_alias</a>, aliases are block-level declarations.

The errors are different depending on the compiler - while g++ gives a meaningful message, saying that templates are not allowed at block scope, clang is completely cryptic.
