There is, in the simple case, nothing much more to the content of a class type object in memory than the members it is made up of (and some padding). When you have a <code>testingPointers</code> object in memory, it is really just an <code>int</code>, a <code>float</code> and a <code>double</code>. The concept of the class was only used to generate the correct executable code - it does not exist at run time (at least not for this purpose).</p>\n<p>The important part from the standard regarding whether objects can share memory addresses is \u00a71.8/6:</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p id=\"so_13484113_13484201_0\">Unless an object is a bit-field or a base class subobject of zero size, the address of that object is the address of the first byte it occupies. Two objects that are not bit-fields may have the same address if one is a subobject of the other, or if at least one is a base class subobject of zero size and they are of different types; otherwise, they shall have distinct addresses.</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>We can infer from this that because member <code>test.i</code> is a subobject of <code>test</code>, they may well have the same address.</p>\n<p>Once you look inside all of the objects of your program as deep as you can go, what you really have is a big collection of scalar values and adjacent bit-fields. These are known as <em>memory locations</em> in the standard. These are the things that really take up space. The rest of your objects are all in some way composed of these.</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p id=\"so_13484113_13484201_1\">A <em>memory location</em> is either an object of scalar type or a maximal sequence of adjacent bit-fields all having non-zero width.
