Putting some more though into it, i think that, while a hack, it makes some sense.\nA array in memory is like this:</p>\n<pre><code>===================================\n... ||  a0  ||  a1  ||  a2   || ...\n===================================\n</code></pre>\n<p>So when you try to store a values that is bigger than one of your array members, it access the memory on the side. So try to store a value of 3 chunks size will work, and end up as this:</p>\n<pre><code>====================================\n... || data  data  data  data || ...\n====================================\n</code></pre>\n<p>So, is this dangerous, or is some kind of obscure harmless hack?</p>\n", "AcceptedAnswerId": "18475470", "Title": "Is this defined behavior?

However, you're calling the assignment operator on an object that hasn't been constructed which is illegal.  The best workaround is something like this:</p>\n<pre><code>std::allocator&lt;largeStruct&gt; al;\nlargeStruct a;\nunsigned char* ptr = new char[sizeof(largeStruct)]; //allocate memory\nal.construct((largeStruct*)ptr, a); //call the copy constructor\n\n....\n\nal.destroy((largeStruct*)ptr); //destroy the object\ndelete[] ptr; //deallocate memory\n</code></pre>\n<p><code>std::allocator</code> is the standard allocator used by default by all of the C++ standard containers. <code>allocate</code> and <code>deallocate</code> simply call <code>new char[]</code> and <code>delete[]</code> respectively. <code>construct</code> constructs the object in place via placement new, and <code>destroy</code> destructs it by manually calling the destructor. You can do both yourself in one line of code each, but using allocators is better practice.</p>\n<p>Alternatively, instead of constructing a copy of a local instance that was default constructed, simply default construct the <code>largeStruct</code> in place with <code>al.construct((largeStruct*)ptr);</code></p>\n", "LastEditorUserId": "845092", "LastActivityDate": "2013-08-27T21:49:50.880", "Score": "4", "CreationDate": "2013-08-27T21:06:05.167", "ParentId": "18475338", "CommentCount": "11", "LastEditDate": "2013-08-27T21:49:50.880", "OwnerUserId": "845092"}});
