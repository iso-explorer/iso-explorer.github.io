Here's a yet different kind of declaration:-</p>\n<pre><code>class Chamber {\n    public:\n    int pot;\n};\n</code></pre>\n<p>But after this declaration, there isn't a variable called <code>pot</code>, or <code>Chamber::pot</code>. In fact there's no new variable at all. I've declared a new class, and <em>when I later declare an instance of that class</em> it will have a member called <code>pot</code>, but right now, nothing is called that.</p>\n<p>A non-static data member of class doesn't create a new variable itself, it just helps you to define the properties of the class. If it did create a new variable, you'd be able to write code like this:</p>\n<pre><code>class Chamber {\n    public:\n    int pot;\n};\n\nvoid f(bool b) {\n    if (b)\n        Chamber::pot = 2;\n}\n</code></pre>\n<p>What would that even mean? Would it find every instance of <code>Chamber</code> and set all their <code>pot</code>s to 2? It's a nonsense.</p>\n<p>A quick footnote: the language of the standard here is talking specifically about references, but to make the examples easier, I've been using non-references. I hope you can see this doesn't change the principle of it.</p>\n", "LastActivityDate": "2012-10-20T10:23:07.440", "CommentCount": "15", "CreationDate": "2012-10-20T10:23:07.440", "ParentId": "12987259", "Score": "6", "OwnerUserId": "967945"}, "bq_ids": {"n4140": {"so_12987259_12987259_0": {"length": 14, "quality": 0.875, "section_id": 7029}}, "n3337": {"so_12987259_12987259_0": {"length": 14, "quality": 0.875, "section_id": 6775}}, "n4659": {"so_12987259_12987259_0": {"length": 14, "quality": 0.875, "section_id": 8526}}}, "12987259": {"ViewCount": "680", "Body": "<p>The definition of a <em>variable</em> in C++11 is as follows (\u00a73/6):</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p id=\"so_12987259_12987259_0\">A <em>variable</em> is introduced by the declaration of a reference other than a non-static data member or of an object.
