Taken literally, rule #3 would also\n  apply to simply reordering nonstatic data members with no name\n  dependencies at all. Can it be simply removed?</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>and the proposed solution is:</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p id=\"so_26761385_26761386_1\">Delete the third item of 3.3.7 [basic.scope.class] paragraph 1 and\n  renumber the succeeding items</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>Although this defect report seems to confirm my initial suspicious I am left with a nagging feeling that perhaps rule <code>3</code> is bit broader after all. Section <code>3.3.7</code> includes the following example:</p>\n<pre><code>enum { i = 1 };\n\nclass X {\n  char v[i]; // error: i refers to ::i\n             // but when reevaluated is X::i\n  int f() { return sizeof(c); } // OK: X::c\n  char c;\n  enum { i = 2 };\n};\n</code></pre>\n<p>which violates both rule <code>2</code> and <code>3</code> but a small tweak:</p>\n<pre><code>enum { i = 1 };\n\nclass X {\n  enum { i = 2 };\n  char v[i];  // no longer refers to ::i \n              // but reordering can cause it to refer to ::i again\n\n  int f() { return sizeof(c); } // OK: X::c\n  char c;\n};\n</code></pre>\n<p>seems to no longer violate rule <code>2</code> but sure seems to violate rule <code>3</code>. I would consider this code example to be troublesome since a reordering of the members could easily cause the code to be back in violation of rule 2 but no diagnostic is required to indicate this which makes this code rather fragile.</p>\n<p><b>Update</b></p>\n<p>As far as I understand rule <code>3</code> does not apply to this example mentioned by Casey in the comment:</p>\n<pre><code>class X { int a; int b; };\n</code></pre>\n<p>because even though there is more than one valid ordering this case does not fall under both rule <code>1</code> and <code>2</code> which rule <code>3</code> requires:</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p id=\"so_26761385_26761386_2\">alternate valid program under (1) and (2)</p>\n</blockquote>\n", "LastEditorUserId": "1708801", "LastActivityDate": "2014-11-06T10:23:58.553", "Score": "8", "CreationDate": "2014-11-05T15:51:38.090", "ParentId": "26761385", "CommentCount": "10", "LastEditDate": "2014-11-06T10:23:58.553", "OwnerUserId": "1708801"}, "26761385": {"ViewCount": "343", "Body": "<p>I recently <a href=\"https://stackoverflow.com/q/26681873/1708801\">answered a question</a> dealing with a violation of <a href=\"https://github.com/cplusplus/draft/blob/master/papers/n4140.pdf\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">draft C++14 standard: N4140</a> section <code>3.3.7</code> <em>Class scope</em> paragraph <code>1</code> rule <code>2</code> which says:</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p id=\"so_26761385_26761385_0\">A name N used in a class S shall refer to the same declaration in its\n  context and when re-evaluated in the completed scope of S.
