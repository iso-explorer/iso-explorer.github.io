Instead of being a general statement about aliasing, it's describing the situation in which the source of the value being assigned is storage that overlaps the storage of the target object. The proposed resolution should make that clearer rather than changing the specification.</p>\n</blockquote>\n", "OwnerUserId": "964135", "PostTypeId": "2", "Id": "8423839", "Score": "2", "CreationDate": "2011-12-07T22:58:00.723", "LastActivityDate": "2011-12-07T22:58:00.723"}, "8423713": {"CommentCount": "0", "ViewCount": "94", "CreationDate": "2011-12-07T22:45:23.973", "LastActivityDate": "2011-12-07T22:58:00.723", "Title": "Change in standard in assignment operation", "PostTypeId": "1", "Id": "8423713", "Score": "2", "Body": "<p>Can someone explain what was changed about the following in new standard with an example?
