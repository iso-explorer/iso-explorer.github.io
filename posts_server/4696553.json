Implementations <em>could</em> satisfy it by having a single \"golden program\" which they recognise and compile as a special case, although that would be akin to rigging benchmarks. In practice you can read the standard as saying that if your implementation imposes a limit other than available memory, then that limit <em>should</em> be at least 4095. Beyond 4095 you are relying on implementation-specific behavior to an extent.</p>\n<p>Some compilers (Microsoft) impose some implementation limits which are less than the standard says. These are listed somewhere on MSDN I think, but possibly only for C++. As far as C goes, since I'm quoting C99 it might not be relevant to MSVC anyway.</p>\n<p>For GCC and MSVC in particular, it shouldn't be too hard to test whether a given implementation imposes an arbitrary limit, perhaps easier than finding it documented :-) Auto-generate files containing nothing but great long lists of <code>#define</code>, see what the preprocessor makes of them.</p>\n", "LastEditorUserId": "13005", "LastActivityDate": "2011-01-14T22:59:21.920", "Score": "7", "CreationDate": "2011-01-14T22:17:43.420", "ParentId": "4696553", "CommentCount": "1", "OwnerUserId": "13005", "LastEditDate": "2011-01-14T22:59:21.920"}, "4696730": {"Id": "4696730", "PostTypeId": "2", "Body": "<p>The C preprocessor doesn't expand <code>#define</code> before they are actually used.
