Just because they are declared in syntactically similar ways, as <code>Type@</code> with a type and a modifier doesn't make them work the same way. A pointer is a value, an object, and it can be copied and have its value altered by assignment. A reference is not an object, it's a reference to some object.  A reference can't be copied (copying it copies the referent) or altered (assigning to it alters the referent).  A function that returns a pointer returns an object <em>by value</em> (the object in question being a pointer object), but a function that returns a reference (like your <code>GetBigClass()</code>) returns an object <em>by reference</em>. They're completely different semantics, trying to draw analogies between pointers and references is doomed to failure.</p>\n", "OwnerUserId": "981959", "LastEditorUserId": "981959", "LastEditDate": "2012-08-09T18:34:51.313", "Id": "11887501", "Score": "5", "CreationDate": "2012-08-09T16:09:23.977", "LastActivityDate": "2012-08-09T18:34:51.313"}, "11886930": {"CommentCount": "0", "ViewCount": "368", "PostTypeId": "1", "LastEditorUserId": "500104", "CreationDate": "2012-08-09T15:38:12.873", "LastActivityDate": "2012-08-09T18:34:51.313", "Title": "`auto` specifier type deduction for references", "AcceptedAnswerId": "11887501", "LastEditDate": "2012-08-09T15:59:20.557", "Id": "11886930", "Score": "4", "Body": "<p>Let's consider the following code snippet</p>\n<pre><code>void Test()\n  {\n  int x = 0;\n\n  int&amp; rx = x;\n  int* px = &amp;x;\n\n  auto apx = px;    // deduced type is int*\n  auto arx = rx;    // deduced type is int\n  }\n</code></pre>\n<p>One could draw an analogy from pointer types expecting that the deduced type of <code>arx</code> is <code>int&amp;</code>, but it is <code>int</code> in fact. </p>\n<p>What is the rule in Standard which governs that?
