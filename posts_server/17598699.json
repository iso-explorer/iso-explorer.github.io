A template for which there can be no valid instantiation (specialization in standard jargon) is incorrect even if that template is never instantiated.</p>\n<p>In your case, the name <code>B::foo()</code> inside <code>A&lt;T&gt;::A(int)</code> is a non-dependent name, so it needs to be resolved during the first phase lookup, and it can only refer to the <code>B</code> class defined above.
