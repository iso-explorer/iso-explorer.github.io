The default constructor for <code>A</code> is defined as deleted per [class.ctor]/p4. Thus, by [dcl.init]/p8, value-initialization means default-initialization, and by p7 the initialization is ill-formed because the constructor is deleted.</p>\n<p>The C++11 version actually allowed value-initialization in this context; it says for value-initialization that, among other things, </p>\n<blockquote>\n<p id=\"so_27200284_27200678_4\">if T is a (possibly cv-qualified) non-union class type without a\n  user-provided constructor, then the object is zero-initialized and, if\n  T\u2019s implicitly-declared default constructor is non-trivial, that\n  constructor is called.</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>Since by the definition above the default constructor is trivial (even though it is deleted), it is not actually called.
