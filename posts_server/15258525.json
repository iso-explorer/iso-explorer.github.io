Equally good matches would make the call ambiguous, i.e. ill-formed, and better matches would have resulted in a different function being called.</p>\n<p>So <em>if</em> in another context the call would have been ambiguous or caused another sort of error, but succeeds due to only considering a limited set of names in the instantiation and definition contexts, it's undefined.

If two different points of instantiation give a template specialization different meanings according to the one definition rule (3.2), the program is ill-formed, no diagnostic required.</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>Page 426 of the C++ ARM (Ellis &amp; Stroustrup) gives a bit of context for that text (and I believe for 14.6.4.2 as well) and explains it more concisely and clearly than I did above:</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p id=\"so_15258525_15258991_5\">This would seem to imply that a global name used from within a template could be bound to different objects or functions in different compilation units or even at different points within a compilation unit. However, should that happen, the resulting template function or class is rendered illegal by the \"one-definition\" rule (\u00a77.1.2).</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>There's another related formulation of the same rules in [basic.def.odr]/6</p>\n", "OwnerUserId": "981959", "LastEditorUserId": "981959", "LastEditDate": "2013-03-06T22:23:22.570", "Id": "15258991", "Score": "13", "CreationDate": "2013-03-06T22:03:05.373", "LastActivityDate": "2013-03-06T22:23:22.570"}, "bq_ids": {"n4140": {"so_15258525_15258991_1": {"section_id": 5768, "quality": 1.0, "length": 10}, "so_15258525_15258525_0": {"section_id": 224, "quality": 1.0, "length": 36}, "so_15258525_15258991_4": {"section_id": 223, "quality": 1.0, "length": 25}}, "n3337": {"so_15258525_15258991_1": {"section_id": 5541, "quality": 1.0, "length": 10}, "so_15258525_15258525_0": {"section_id": 217, "quality": 1.0, "length": 36}, "so_15258525_15258991_4": {"section_id": 216, "quality": 1.0, "length": 25}}, "n4659": {"so_15258525_15258991_1": {"section_id": 7225, "quality": 0.7, "length": 7}, "so_15258525_15258525_0": {"section_id": 232, "quality": 1.0, "length": 36}, "so_15258525_15258991_4": {"section_id": 231, "quality": 0.92, "length": 23}}}});
