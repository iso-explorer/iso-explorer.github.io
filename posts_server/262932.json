An example from my own experience where this was useful was when I switched from using native types for intermediate results of calculations to arbitrary-precision integers, which are implemented as a class.</p>\n", "OwnerUserId": "31000", "Id": "263105", "PostTypeId": "2", "OwnerDisplayName": "Nathan Kitchen", "Score": "2", "CreationDate": "2008-11-04T19:34:31.053", "LastActivityDate": "2008-11-04T19:34:31.053"}, "263107": {"ParentId": "262932", "CommentCount": "0", "Body": "<p>Konrad Rudolph is right.
