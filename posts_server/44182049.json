You should remember that when you call <code>delete</code> on a pointer you pass argument by value, so memory, where <code>a</code> points to after <code>delete</code> is not usable anymore, but that call does not make <code>a</code> any different than <code>b</code> in your example.</p>\n", "OwnerUserId": "432358", "PostTypeId": "2", "Id": "44182329", "Score": "-1", "CreationDate": "2017-05-25T13:52:50.683", "LastActivityDate": "2017-05-25T13:52:50.683"}, "44186548": {"ParentId": "44182049", "LastEditDate": "2017-05-26T05:43:53.830", "CommentCount": "11", "CreationDate": "2017-05-25T17:35:03.117", "OwnerUserId": "6308879", "LastEditorUserId": "6308879", "PostTypeId": "2", "Id": "44186548", "Score": "-1", "Body": "<p>You <strong>should not</strong> use the pointer after <code>delete</code>.
