In C++ or Java a method in any given class are recognized by the method signature, the signature here is defined as name of the method and type and number of parameters the method accepts. The return type is not part of the method signature and therefore having a method overloaded that differs only by their return type is not acceptable in these programming languages. In your example: <code> int x = f(); </code> you are assuming that the user will type <code> int x </code> however the programmer doesn't really have to do that! With the preamble I explained about method signature when the user calls <code> f() </code> there is no way for the compiler to recognize if you re calling the first one or the second one. That being said some modern programming languages allow overloading based on the return type.
