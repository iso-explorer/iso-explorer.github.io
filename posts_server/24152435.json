If that were not possible, then one would need to create another object, or a managing class, to represent that state in a legal way. Having that ability already contained in all container classes, is very helpful. In using it, one then just needs to be in the habit of relating to the array as a container that might be empty, and checking the size or index before referring to a member of it in cases where it might not point to anything.</p>\n", "LastActivityDate": "2014-06-11T06:47:59.850", "CommentCount": "0", "CreationDate": "2014-06-11T06:47:59.850", "ParentId": "24152435", "Score": "1", "OwnerUserId": "471736"}, "bq_ids": {"n4140": {"so_24152435_24152435_3": {"length": 6, "quality": 0.8571428571428571, "section_id": 790}, "so_24152435_24152435_2": {"length": 5, "quality": 0.625, "section_id": 789}, "so_24152435_24152435_1": {"length": 8, "quality": 0.8, "section_id": 788}, "so_24152435_24152435_0": {"length": 4, "quality": 0.8, "section_id": 787}}, "n3337": {"so_24152435_24152435_1": {"length": 8, "quality": 0.8, "section_id": 775}, "so_24152435_24152435_3": {"length": 6, "quality": 0.8571428571428571, "section_id": 777}, "so_24152435_24152435_2": {"length": 5, "quality": 0.625, "section_id": 776}, "so_24152435_24152435_0": {"length": 4, "quality": 0.8, "section_id": 774}}, "n4659": {"so_24152435_24152435_3": {"length": 4, "quality": 0.5714285714285714, "section_id": 851}, "so_24152435_24152435_2": {"length": 5, "quality": 0.625, "section_id": 850}, "so_24152435_24152435_1": {"length": 8, "quality": 0.8, "section_id": 849}, "so_24152435_24152435_0": {"length": 4, "quality": 0.8, "section_id": 848}}}, "24152608": {"Id": "24152608", "PostTypeId": "2", "Body": "<p>If you have a generic function it is bad if that function randomly breaks for special parameters.
