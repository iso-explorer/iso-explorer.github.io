See C++11 (N3485) \u00a7 8.5.1/1:</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p id=\"so_21340801_21341177_0\">An aggregate is an array or a class (Clause 9) with no user-provided constructors (12.1),  no <em>brace-or-equal-initializers</em> for non-static data members (9.2), no private or protected non-static data members (Clause 11), no base classes (Clause 10), and no virtual functions (10.3).</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>A constructor with a definition of <code>= default</code> is considered not user-defined.</p>\n<p>Then, going down to list-initialization in \u00a7 8.5.4, we see:</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p id=\"so_21340801_21341177_1\">List-initialization of an object or reference of type T is de\ufb01ned as follows:  </p>\n<ul>\n<li>If T is an aggregate, aggregate initialization is performed</li>\n</ul>\n</blockquote>\n<p>And then a bunch of \"Otherwise...\" sections. Thus, changing either of these allows a constructor to be called instead of performing aggregate initialization. </p>\n<p>The new proposed standardese for the list-initialization definition (as viewable in Johannes's link) provides a prioritized case of a single element in the list, and it having a type of (or really close to) the type of the object being initialized. Aggregate initialization would then be top priority after that.</p>\n", "OwnerUserId": "962089", "LastEditorUserId": "962089", "LastEditDate": "2014-01-24T19:51:07.347", "Id": "21341177", "Score": "3", "CreationDate": "2014-01-24T19:44:56.337", "LastActivityDate": "2014-01-24T19:51:07.347"}, "21340989": {"ParentId": "21340801", "CommentCount": "1", "Body": "<p>This is a known bug and will hopefully be fixed in C++17 (not for C++14, see <a href=\"http://www.open-std.org/jtc1/sc22/wg21/docs/cwg_active.html#1467\" rel=\"noreferrer\">http://www.open-std.org/jtc1/sc22/wg21/docs/cwg_active.html#1467</a>).
