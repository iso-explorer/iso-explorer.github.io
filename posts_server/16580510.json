The C standard uses the term <em>selection statement</em>. The C language has three different selection statements: <code>if</code>, <code>if-else</code> and <code>switch</code> (C11 6.8.4). Loops sort under the category of <em>iteration statements</em> (6.8.5).</p>\n<p>The <code>break</code> statement is a jump statement, just like <code>goto</code>.

It works with <code>switch</code> <em>and</em> loops.
