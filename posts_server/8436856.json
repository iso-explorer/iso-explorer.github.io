A constructor that takes a single parameter of class type by-value is, by definition, not a copy constructor (edit) -- and in fact is illegal, as pointed out by Cat Plus Plus.</p>\n<h2>12.1 : Constructors</h2>\n<blockquote>\n<p id=\"so_8436856_8436953_0\">10/A copy constructor for a class X is a constructor with a first parameter of type X&amp; or of type const X&amp;</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>Beyond this Standardese, however, is a fundamental error in your understanding of the copy constructor.  Consider the following code:</p>\n<pre><code>class Foo\n{\npublic:\n  Foo() {}\n  Foo(Foo f) {/*...*/};\n};\n\nint main()\n{\n  Foo f1;\n  Foo f2(f1);\n}\n</code></pre>\n<p>When <code>f2</code> is constructed <code>f1</code> is passed by-value.  In order to evaluate the parameters for the constructor call, <code>f1</code> must be copied.  So, you see there is a paradox here.  In order to call the copy constructor, you must make a copy.  In order to make a copy, you must call the copy constructor...</p>\n<p>The above must call the constructor with an argument by-value simply because that is what the type of the parameter <strong>is</strong>:  it's a <code>Foo</code> by-value.  It it were not by-value, it would have to be either by reference, which looks like this:</p>\n<pre><code>Foo(Foo&amp; rhs)\n/* or like this: */ Foo(const Foo&amp; rhs);\n</code></pre>\n<p>...or it must take it by pointer, which looks like this:</p>\n<pre><code>Foo(Foo* prhs)\n</code></pre>\n<p>...but, in the latter case, this is obviously not a copy constructor given the definition above.</p>\n", "LastActivityDate": "2011-12-08T20:14:06.517"}, "8436955": {"ParentId": "8436856", "CommentCount": "6", "Body": "<p><code>complex(complex)</code> is not a copy constructor.
