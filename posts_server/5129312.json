An object is a region of storage. [Note: A function is not an object, regardless of whether or not it occupies storage in the way that objects do. ] An object is created by a definition (basic.def), by a new-expression (expr.new) or by the implementation (class.temporary) when needed. The properties of an object are determined when the object is created. An object can have a name (clause basic). An object has a storage duration (basic.stc) which influences its lifetime (basic.life). An object has a type (basic.types). The term object type refers to the type with which the object is created. </p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>It's also implicit in this statement from 3.9.1:</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p id=\"so_5129312_5129407_1\">Types describe objects (intro.object), references (dcl.ref), or functions (dcl.fct).</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>Obviously, for \"objects\" to group everything that's typed other than references or functions, it must include <code>int</code> et al.</p>\n<p>It's worth noting that basic types like <code>int</code> are not objects in the \"Object Oriented\" sense, but that's pretty obvious from the fact that they're the same as in C which is not an Object Oriented language.</p>\n", "LastActivityDate": "2011-02-26T20:03:40.780", "CommentCount": "0", "CreationDate": "2011-02-26T20:03:40.780", "ParentId": "5129312", "Score": "2", "OwnerUserId": "410767"}, "5129346": {"Id": "5129346", "PostTypeId": "2", "Body": "<p>Yes, it is.
