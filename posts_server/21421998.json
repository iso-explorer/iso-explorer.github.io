However, since you're limited to the range <code>0..255</code> (assuming 8 bits) because of the destination, it wraps around to ensure that range is maintained. Hence you basically add <code>256</code> to <code>-79</code> to end up with <code>177</code>.</p>\n<p>In other words, <code>9 - 10</code> which would give you <code>-1</code> in a signed value, actually gives you <code>255</code> for an 8-bit <code>unsigned char</code>.
