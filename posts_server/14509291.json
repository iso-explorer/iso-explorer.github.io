The function is marked protected in the base. When I do so, the code compiles happily in Clang (Apple LLVM Compiler 4.1) but gives an error in both g++ 4.7.2 and in Visual Studio 2010. The error is along the lines of: \"'Base::foo' : cannot access protected member.\"</p>\n<p>The implication is that the context for the reference is actually within <code>bind()</code>, where of course the function is seen as protected. But shouldn't <code>bind()</code> inherit the context of the calling function--in this case, <code>Derived::foo()</code>--and therefore see the base method as accessible?</p>\n<p>The following program illustrates the issue.</p>\n<pre><code>struct Base\n{\nprotected: virtual void foo() {}\n};\n\nstruct Derived : public Base\n{\nprotected:\n    virtual void foo() override\n    {\n        Base::foo();                        // Legal\n\n        auto fn = std::bind( &amp;Derived::foo, \n            std::placeholders::_1 );        // Legal but unwanted.\n        fn( this );\n\n        auto fn2 = std::bind( &amp;Base::foo, \n            std::placeholders::_1 );        // ILLEGAL in G++ 4.7.2 and VS2010.\n        fn2( this );\n    }\n};\n</code></pre>\n<p>Why the discrepancy in behavior?

If the access is to form\n  a pointer to member (5.3.1), the nested-name-specifier shall name C or\n  a class derived from C. All other accesses involve a (possibly\n  implicit) object expression (5.2.5). In this case, the class of the\n  object expression shall be C or a class derived from C. </p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>Workaround: make <code>foo</code> a <code>public</code> member function</p>\n<pre><code>#include &lt;functional&gt;\n\nstruct Base\n{\npublic: virtual void foo() {}\n};\n</code></pre>\n", "LastEditorUserId": "-1", "LastActivityDate": "2013-01-24T20:00:26.977", "Score": "9", "CreationDate": "2013-01-24T19:55:08.347", "ParentId": "14509291", "CommentCount": "1", "OwnerUserId": "819272", "LastEditDate": "2017-05-23T12:30:32.147"}, "14510123": {"Id": "14510123", "PostTypeId": "2", "Body": "<p>This has nothing to do with <code>bind</code>.
