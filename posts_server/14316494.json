There's no reason for the linker to look for the symbol, so it doesn't.</p>\n<p>The second one, with the <code>virtual</code> method, is a bit more complicated. Most compilers (if not all) required <strong>valid virtual function tables</strong>. That means that at link time, all classes that declared non-pure virtual methods would have to have those methods exported. This is stricter than the non-<code>virtual</code> case because the implementation doesn't actually know whether the function is called or not (it could be called polymorphically).</p>\n", "LastEditorUserId": "673730", "LastActivityDate": "2013-01-14T10:33:07.767", "Score": "15", "CreationDate": "2013-01-14T10:21:57.913", "ParentId": "14316494", "CommentCount": "4", "OwnerUserId": "673730", "LastEditDate": "2013-01-14T10:33:07.767"}, "14316494": {"ViewCount": "1117", "Body": "<p>I have this class,</p>\n<pre><code>class Base {\n    public:\n        void foo();\n};\n\nint main()\n{\n    Base b;\n}\n</code></pre>\n<p><code>main</code> will compile without any error, although <code>foo()</code> has no definition.
