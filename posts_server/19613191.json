The current version of <a href=\"http://www.stroustrup.com/Programming/std_lib_facilities.h\" rel=\"nofollow\">std_lib_facilities.h</a> includes the following line:</p>\n<pre><code>inline double sqrt(int x) { return sqrt(double(x)); }   // to match C++0x\n</code></pre>\n<p>which creates a specific overload for the <em>int</em> case to match what modern compilers should be be doing which is <em>cast integer arguments to double</em>, although this version does not cover all the cases.</p>\n<p>If <em>std_lib_facilities.h</em> was not being used than the original logic still applies, although <code>gcc-4.2</code> is rather old compared to <em>Visual Studio 2012</em> from the original question but a <code>4.1.2</code> version have uses <code>__builtin_sqrt</code> specifically for the integer case.</p>\n<p><b>Original</b></p>\n<p>Since around <em>2005</em> the draft standard required <em>integer</em> argument to be <em>cast</em> to <em>double</em> this is covered in the <a href=\"http://www.open-std.org/jtc1/sc22/wg21/docs/papers/2012/n3485.pdf\" rel=\"nofollow\">draft C++ standard</a>. If we look in section <code>26</code> <em>Numerics library</em> and then go to section <code>26.8</code> <em>C library</em> which covers the <code>&lt;cmath&gt;</code> header, it specifies overloads of the math functions for <em>float</em>, <em>double</em> and <em>long double</em> which is covered in paragraph <em>8</em>:</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p id=\"so_19613191_19684955_0\">In addition to the double versions of the math functions in , C++ adds float and long double overloaded versions of these functions, with the same semantics.</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>which would be <code>ambiguous</code> for the <code>int</code> case but the standard requires that sufficient overload are provided so that <em>integer</em> arguments are <em>cast</em> to <em>double</em>. It is covered in paragraph <em>11</em> which says(<em>emphasis mine</em>):</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p id=\"so_19613191_19684955_1\">Moreover, there shall be additional overloads sufficient to ensure:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"so_19613191_19684955_2\">\n<ol>\n<li>If any arithmetic argument corresponding to a double parameter has type long double, then all arithmetic arguments corresponding to double parameters are effectively cast to long double.</li>\n<li>Otherwise, if any arithmetic argument corresponding to a double parameter has type double or an integer type, <strong>then all arithmetic arguments corresponding to double parameters are effectively cast to double.</strong></li>\n<li>Otherwise, all arithmetic arguments corresponding to double parameters have type float.</li>\n</ol>\n</blockquote>\n</blockquote>\n<p><b>Update</b></p>\n<p>As @nos points out it is possible that the version of <code>sqrt</code> being called is from <code>math.h</code> header as opposed to the overloads from <code>cmath</code>, if that is the case and there is likely a <em>implementation defined</em> caveat here then we <em>may</em> be reverting to old <em>C style</em> behavior if the only version available is <code>sqrt(double)</code> which would mean that <em>int</em> would be converted to <em>double implicitly</em>.</p>\n<p>One way I found to test this on <code>gcc</code> and <code>clang</code> would be to use <em>long</em> type for <code>a</code> which along with <code>-Wconversion</code> flag triggers a warning for a potentially value altering conversion on my platform if we only have <code>sqrt(double)</code> available. Indeed if I include <code>math.h</code> instead of <code>cmath</code> we can produce this warning. Although I can not trigger this behavior in <em>clang</em> which seems to indicate this is <em>implementation dependent</em>.</p>\n", "LastEditorUserId": "1708801", "LastActivityDate": "2013-12-20T04:02:31.830", "Score": "4", "CreationDate": "2013-10-30T14:24:04.913", "ParentId": "19613191", "CommentCount": "1", "OwnerUserId": "1708801", "LastEditDate": "2013-12-20T04:02:31.830"}, "19684504": {"Id": "19684504", "PostTypeId": "2", "Body": "<p>The 10 is being implicitly converted to a double.
