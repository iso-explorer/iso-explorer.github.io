If you don't allocate memory using <code>new</code>, it's not your responsibility to <code>delete</code> it unless explicitly stated otherwise. In general, whoever allocates memory is responsible for freeing it. That said, many popular libraries still have leaks in them. If <code>char*</code> would be an array or similar which was dynamically allocated on the heap, you need to delete it from where it was allocated (not in these functions).</p>\n<p>Regards,<br/>\nDennis M.</p>\n", "CreationDate": "2011-03-05T22:01:22.650", "ParentId": "5206957", "Id": "5207076", "LastActivityDate": "2011-03-05T22:01:22.650", "PostTypeId": "2", "Score": "1", "OwnerUserId": "388182"}, "5207081": {"CommentCount": "0", "Body": "<p>Please post your complete code so we can find the problem. </p>\n<p>Also you might want to check:</p>\n<pre><code>Draw(\"C:\\a.bmp\", \"C:\\b.bmp\")\n</code></pre>\n<p>The '\\' escapes the 'a' respective 'b'.</p>\n", "CreationDate": "2011-03-05T22:02:10.603", "ParentId": "5206957", "Id": "5207081", "LastActivityDate": "2011-03-05T22:02:10.603", "PostTypeId": "2", "Score": "0", "OwnerUserId": "618598"}});
