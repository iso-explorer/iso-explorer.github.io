If you're going to handle a out-of-memory exception and have code to do so, then by all means, put it in a try-catch. If you're not writing mission-critical code and don't expect to be operating on the edge of system memory constraints, it's likely not necessary. Note that pretty much every line of code you write can throw exceptions once your system is out of memory.</p>\n<p>It's important to note that on modern hardware/operating systems, \"out of memory\" doesn't mean that you've exceeded the physical memory constraints - you can have only 128MiB of memory and not get an error even when you use 10 times that, and you can have 8GiB of physical memory and get that error when you've only used half that much. This refers to the memory space available to your application, which the OS will page to disk if necessary (and assuming available disk space).</p>\n", "LastEditorUserId": "17027", "LastActivityDate": "2013-01-01T10:37:14.513", "Score": "9", "CreationDate": "2013-01-01T10:15:55.513", "ParentId": "14109542", "CommentCount": "0", "OwnerUserId": "17027", "LastEditDate": "2013-01-01T10:37:14.513"}, "bq_ids": {"n4140": {"so_14109542_14109569_0": {"length": 9, "quality": 0.8181818181818182, "section_id": 4383}}, "n3337": {"so_14109542_14109569_0": {"length": 9, "quality": 0.8181818181818182, "section_id": 4220}}, "n4659": {"so_14109542_14109569_0": {"length": 9, "quality": 0.8181818181818182, "section_id": 5648}}}, "14109568": {"Id": "14109568", "PostTypeId": "2", "Body": "<p><code>shared_ptr</code> needs to allocate the counter, so it can throw\n<code>bad_alloc</code>.
