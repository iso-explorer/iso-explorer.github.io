The language already contains a means to the end that you are looking for- braces. They are much more reliable and useful than abusing the comma operator like you have. For example, if you are using UDTs, then you are going to run into some nasty surprises when I overload the comma operator. Oops!</p>\n<p>More to the point, having <code>return</code> as an expression doesn't make sense, because the function has already, well, returned, when it is evaluated, so there's no way anyone could possibly use any hypothetical return value.</p>\n<p>Your entire question is predicated on your personal dislike of braces. Nobody else who designs the language really shares that feeling.</p>\n", "OwnerUserId": "298661", "LastEditorUserId": "298661", "LastEditDate": "2013-12-24T18:49:19.950", "Id": "20765399", "Score": "0", "CreationDate": "2013-12-24T18:37:23.143", "LastActivityDate": "2013-12-24T18:49:19.950"}, "bq_ids": {"n4140": {"so_20765045_20765055_2": {"section_id": 6182, "quality": 0.8333333333333334, "length": 5}, "so_20765045_20765055_1": {"section_id": 6182, "quality": 0.8, "length": 4}}, "n3337": {"so_20765045_20765055_2": {"section_id": 5943, "quality": 0.8333333333333334, "length": 5}, "so_20765045_20765055_1": {"section_id": 5943, "quality": 0.8, "length": 4}}, "n4659": {"so_20765045_20765055_2": {"section_id": 7684, "quality": 0.8333333333333334, "length": 5}, "so_20765045_20765055_1": {"section_id": 7684, "quality": 0.8, "length": 4}}}, "20765045": {"CommentCount": "22", "AcceptedAnswerId": "20765069", "PostTypeId": "1", "LastEditorUserId": "2877241", "CreationDate": "2013-12-24T18:02:48.787", "LastActivityDate": "2015-12-07T12:20:36.537", "LastEditDate": "2015-12-07T12:20:36.537", "ViewCount": "754", "FavoriteCount": "1", "Title": "Why exactly this will not compile if (a) b = c, d = e, return;?", "Id": "20765045", "Score": "7", "Body": "<p>I am addicted to \"braceless\" ifs, like this:</p>\n<pre><code>if (a) b++, c++, d = e; \n</code></pre>\n<p>But one annoying thing is that <code>return</code> cannot be a part of the last part.
