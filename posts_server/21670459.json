First, allow me a small digression to point out that \"why\" can have closely related yet subtly different meanings, namely \"for what <em>cause</em>\", \"for what <em>reason</em>\", and \"for what <em>purpose</em>\". I will group the answers by which of those meanings of \"why\" they addressed.</p>\n<h3>for what cause</h3>\n<p>The main answer here comes from <a href=\"https://stackoverflow.com/a/21670570/1072468\">Paul Draper</a>, with <a href=\"https://stackoverflow.com/a/21670751/1072468\">Martin J</a> contributing a similar but not as extensive answer. Paul Draper's answer boils down to</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p id=\"so_21670459_21670459_2\">It is undefined behavior because it is not defined what the behavior is.</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>The answer is overall very good in terms of explaining what the C++ standard says. It also addresses some related cases of UB such as <code>f(++i, ++i);</code> and <code>f(i=1, i=-1);</code>. In the first of the related cases, it's not clear if the first argument should be <code>i+1</code> and the second <code>i+2</code> or vice versa; in the second, it's not clear if <code>i</code> should be 1 or -1 after the function call. Both of these cases are UB because they fall under the following rule:</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p id=\"so_21670459_21670459_3\">If a side effect on a scalar object is unsequenced relative to another side effect on the same scalar object, the behavior is undefined.</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>Therefore, <code>f(i=-1, i=-1)</code> is also UB since it falls under the same rule, despite that the intention of the programmer is (IMHO) obvious and unambiguous.</p>\n<p>Paul Draper also makes it explicit in his conclusion that</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p id=\"so_21670459_21670459_4\">Could it have been defined behavior? Yes. Was it defined? No.</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>which brings us to the question of \"for what reason/purpose was <code>f(i=-1, i=-1)</code> left as undefined behavior?\"</p>\n<h3>for what reason / purpose</h3>\n<p>Although there are some oversights (maybe careless) in the C++ standard, many omissions are well-reasoned and serve a specific purpose. Although I am aware that the purpose is often either \"make the compiler-writer's job easier\", or \"faster code\", <strong>I was mainly interested to know if there is a good reason leave</strong> <code>f(i=-1, i=-1)</code> <strong>as UB.</strong></p>\n<p><a href=\"https://stackoverflow.com/a/21671069/1072468\">harmic</a> and <a href=\"https://stackoverflow.com/a/21683253/1072468\">supercat</a> provide the main answers that provide a <em>reason</em> for the UB. Harmic points out that an optimizing compiler that might break up the ostensibly atomic assignment operations into multiple machine instructions, and that it might further interleave those instructions for optimal speed. This could lead to some very surprising results: <code>i</code> ends up as -2 in his scenario! Thus, harmic demonstrates how assigning the <em>same value</em> to a variable more than once can have ill effects if the operations are unsequenced.</p>\n<p>supercat provides a related exposition of the pitfalls of trying to get <code>f(i=-1, i=-1)</code> to do what it looks like it ought to do. He points out that on some architectures, there are hard restrictions against multiple simultaneous writes to the same memory address. A compiler could have a hard time catching this if we were dealing with something less trivial than <code>f(i=-1, i=-1)</code>.</p>\n<p><a href=\"https://stackoverflow.com/a/21708746/1072468\">davidf</a> also provides an example of interleaving instructions very similar to harmic's.</p>\n<p>Although each of harmic's, supercat's and davidf' examples are somewhat contrived, taken together they still serve to provide a tangible reason why <code>f(i=-1, i=-1)</code> should be undefined behavior.</p>\n<p>I accepted harmic's answer because it did the best job of addressing all meanings of why, even though Paul Draper's answer addressed the \"for what cause\" portion better.</p>\n<h3>other answers</h3>\n<p><a href=\"https://stackoverflow.com/a/21679403/1072468\">JohnB</a> points out that if we consider overloaded assignment operators (instead of just plain scalars), then we can run into trouble as well.</p>\n</hr></hr>", "Tags": "<c++><language-lawyer><undefined-behavior>", "OwnerUserId": "1072468", "AnswerCount": "11"}, "21708746": {"ParentId": "21670459", "CommentCount": "6", "Body": "<p>The confusion is that storing a constant value into a local variable is not one atomic instruction on every architecture the C is designed to be run on.

If a compiler for such a machine notices two unsequenced attempts to write the same variable, it might either refuse to compile or ensure that the two writes cannot get scheduled simultaneously.

Trying to store two different values in unsequenced fashion could cause weirdness if a compiler isn't aware of it; for example, given:</p>\n<pre><code>uint8_t v;  // Global\n\nvoid hey(uint8_t *p)\n{\n  moo(v=5, (*p)=6);\n  zoo(v);\n  zoo(v);\n}\n</code></pre>\n<p>if the compiler in-lines the call to \"moo\" and can tell it doesn't modify\n\"v\", it might store a 5 to v, then store a 6 to *p, then pass 5 to \"zoo\",\nand then pass the contents of v to \"zoo\".  If \"zoo\" doesn't modify \"v\",\nthere should be no way the two calls should be passed different values,\nbut that could easily happen anyway.  On the other hand, in cases where\nboth stores would write the same value, such weirdness could not occur and\nthere would on most platforms be no sensible reason for an implementation\nto do anything weird.  Unfortunately, some compiler writers don't need any\nexcuse for silly behaviors beyond \"because the Standard allows it\", so even\nthose cases aren't safe.</p>\n", "OwnerUserId": "363751", "LastEditorUserId": "363751", "LastEditDate": "2016-05-26T19:41:09.890", "Id": "21683253", "Score": "11", "CreationDate": "2014-02-10T16:55:18.973", "LastActivityDate": "2016-05-26T19:41:09.890"}, "21670811": {"ParentId": "21670459", "CommentCount": "3", "Body": "<p>This is just answering the \"I'm not sure what \"scalar object\" could mean besides something like an int or a float\".</p>\n<p>I would interpret the \"scalar object\" as a abbreviation of \"scalar type object\", or just \"scalar type variable\".
