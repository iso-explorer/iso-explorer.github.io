The variable\u2019s name denotes\n  the reference or object.</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p><sub>Source: C++11 working draft <a href=\"http://www.open-std.org/jtc1/sc22/wg21/docs/papers/2012/n3337.pdf\" rel=\"nofollow\">n3337</a></sub></p>\n<blockquote>\n<p id=\"so_26711536_26711765_2\">When the initialization statement over, the variable would be cleared?</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>No, it wouldn't. It has no name and at that point it's already destroyed anyway.</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p id=\"so_26711536_26711765_3\">It would be copied to the vector?</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>Yes, the temporary object would be copied into the vector, and then destroyed. This happens in principle; in practice, the compiler is allowed to optimize away the creation, copying and destruction of the temporary object as long as doing so doesn't affect observable behavior.</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p id=\"so_26711536_26711765_4\">Have any differences from c++11 (at this point)?</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>I can't tell for sure, but I can't recall any specific difference between C++98, C++03 and C++11 in this matter.</p>\n", "OwnerUserId": "3477950", "LastEditorDisplayName": "user3920237", "LastEditDate": "2014-11-03T10:02:54.327", "Id": "26711765", "Score": "2", "CreationDate": "2014-11-03T10:00:04.273", "LastActivityDate": "2014-11-03T10:02:54.327"}, "bq_ids": {"n4140": {"so_26711536_26711765_1": {"section_id": 7029, "quality": 0.875, "length": 14}}, "n3337": {"so_26711536_26711765_1": {"section_id": 6775, "quality": 0.875, "length": 14}}, "n4659": {"so_26711536_26711765_1": {"section_id": 8526, "quality": 0.875, "length": 14}}}});
