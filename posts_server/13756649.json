This has the convenient property that <em>I</em> decide which index is the rows and which is the columns. In other words, I can think of <code>int arr[3][4];</code> as a 2D array either with 3 rows and 4 columns or with 4 rows and 3 columns. As long as my code is consistent with my mental view of the array, all will work out fine. However, if half-way through a program I switch views, things will start breaking.</p>\n<p>With that said, usually I prefer to think of this example as 3 rows and 4 columns since this is similar to the mathematical notation in linear algebra where rows are listed first.</p>\n", "OwnerUserId": "1440565", "PostTypeId": "2", "Id": "13756743", "Score": "0", "CreationDate": "2012-12-07T04:05:05.787", "LastActivityDate": "2012-12-07T04:05:05.787"}});
