An expression may also contain intermediate <code>sequence points</code>.</p>\n<p>From the above sentence the following expressions invoke Undefined Behaviour:</p>\n<pre><code>i++ * ++i;   // UB, i is modified more than once btw two SPs\ni = ++i;     // UB, same as above\n++i = 2;     // UB, same as above\ni = ++i + 1; // UB, same as above\n++++++i;     // UB, parsed as (++(++(++i)))\n\ni = (i, ++i, ++i); // UB, there's no SP between `++i` (right most) and assignment to `i` (`i` is modified more than once btw two SPs)\n</code></pre>\n<p>But the following expressions are fine:</p>\n<pre><code>i = (i, ++i, 1) + 1; // well defined (AFAIK)\ni = (++i, i++, i);   // well defined \nint j = i;\nj = (++i, i++, j*i); // well defined\n</code></pre>\n<hr>\n<ul>\n<li>2) <strong>Furthermore, the prior value shall be accessed only to determine the value to be stored.</strong></li>\n</ul>\n<p>What does it mean? It means if an object is written to within a full expression, any and all accesses to it within the same expression <strong>must be directly involved in the computation of the value to be written</strong>. </p>\n<p>For example in <code>i = i + 1</code> all the access of <code>i</code> (in L.H.S and in R.H.S) are <strong>directly involved in computation</strong> of the value to be written. So it is fine.</p>\n<p>This rule effectively constrains legal expressions to those in which the accesses demonstrably precede the modification.</p>\n<p>Example 1:</p>\n<pre><code>std::printf(\"%d %d\", i,++i); // invokes Undefined Behaviour because of Rule no 2\n</code></pre>\n<p>Example 2:</p>\n<pre><code>a[i] = i++ // or a[++i] = i or a[i++] = ++i etc\n</code></pre>\n<p>is disallowed because one of the accesses of <code>i</code> (the one in <code>a[i]</code>) has nothing to do with the value which ends up being stored in i (which happens over in <code>i++</code>), and so there's no good way to define--either for our understanding or the compiler's--whether the access should take place before or after the incremented value is stored. So the behaviour is undefined.</p>\n<p>Example 3 :</p>\n<pre><code>int x = i + i++ ;// Similar to above\n</code></pre>\n<hr>\n<p><strong>Follow up answer <a href=\"https://stackoverflow.com/questions/4176328/faq-undefined-behavior-and-sequence-points/4183735#4183735\">here</a>.</strong> </p>\n</hr></hr></hr></hr></hr></hr></hr></hr>", "CreationDate": "2010-11-14T05:39:00.593", "ParentId": "4176328", "CommentCount": "34", "LastEditDate": "2017-05-23T10:31:37.937", "Id": "4176333", "PostTypeId": "2", "LastActivityDate": "2016-11-28T02:02:33.150", "LastEditorUserId": "-1", "CommunityOwnedDate": "2010-11-15T12:43:12.057", "Score": "590", "OwnerUserId": "165520"}, "46171943": {"Body": "<p><strong>C++17</strong> (<code>N4659</code>) includes a proposal <a href=\"http://www.open-std.org/jtc1/sc22/wg21/docs/papers/2016/p0145r3.pdf\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">Refining Expression Evaluation Order for Idiomatic C++</a>\nwhich defines a stricter order of expression evaluation.</p>\n<p>In particular, the <strong><em>following sentence</em></strong> was added:</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p id=\"so_4176328_46171943_0\"><strong>8.18 Assignment and compound assignment operators</strong>:<br>....</br></p>\n<p id=\"so_4176328_46171943_1\">In all cases, the assignment is sequenced after the value\n  computation of the right and left operands, and before the value computation of the assignment expression.\n  <strong><em>The right operand is sequenced before the left operand.</em></strong></p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>It makes several cases of previously undefined behavior valid, including the one in question:</p>\n<pre><code>a[++i] = i;\n</code></pre>\n<p>However several other similar cases still lead to undefined behavior.</p>\n<p>In <code>N4140</code>:</p>\n<pre><code>i = i++ + 1; // the behavior is undefined\n</code></pre>\n<p>But in <code>N4659</code></p>\n<pre><code>i = i++ + 1; // the value of i is incremented\ni = i++ + i; // the behavior is undefined\n</code></pre>\n<p>Of course, using a C++17 compliant compiler does not necessarily mean that one should start writing such expressions.</p>\n", "CreationDate": "2017-09-12T08:50:14.223", "ParentId": "4176328", "CommentCount": "0", "LastEditDate": "2017-09-12T14:58:59.887", "Id": "46171943", "PostTypeId": "2", "LastActivityDate": "2017-09-12T14:58:59.887", "LastEditorUserId": "2932052", "CommunityOwnedDate": "2017-09-12T08:50:14.223", "Score": "3", "OwnerUserId": "3246555"}, "4176328": {"ViewCount": "83240", "FavoriteCount": "533", "AcceptedAnswerId": "4176333", "Title": "Undefined behavior and sequence points", "CreationDate": "2010-11-14T05:37:46.333", "Id": "4176328", "CommentCount": "0", "Body": "<p>What are \"sequence points\"?</p>\n<p>What is the relation between undefined behaviour and sequence points?</p>\n<p>I often use funny and convoluted expressions like <code>a[++i] = i;</code>, to make myself feel better.
