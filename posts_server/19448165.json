The only relevant part which mentions templates and linkage is C++11, [temp]\u00a74:</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p id=\"so_19448165_19449007_0\">A template name has linkage (3.5). A non-member function template can have internal linkage; any other template name shall have external linkage. Specializations (explicit or implicit) of a template that has internal linkage are distinct from all specializations in other translation units. <strong>A template, a template explicit specialization (14.7.3), and a class template partial specialization shall not have C linkage.</strong> Use of a linkage specification other than C or C++ with any of these constructs is conditionally-supported, with implementation-defined semantics. <em>[...]</em></p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>(Emphasis mine)</p>\n<p>The paragraph starts with template <em>names</em> having linkage. Then it says \"funciton <em>template</em> <code>(not</code><em><code>name</code></em><code>)</code> can have internal linkage; any other template <em>name</em> shall have external linkage.\"</p>\n<p>To me, this seems to imply referring to the linkage of a template refers to the linkage of the template's <em>name.</em> If that interpretation is correct, then your example is well-formed, as the bolded part would apply to template <em>names</em> as well. Then nothing prevents function template <em>types</em> from having C linkage.</p>\n<p>That's how I would interpret the standard.</p>\n", "OwnerUserId": "1782465", "PostTypeId": "2", "Id": "19449007", "Score": "1", "CreationDate": "2013-10-18T11:52:35.513", "LastActivityDate": "2013-10-18T11:52:35.513"}, "19448165": {"CommentCount": "5", "ViewCount": "191", "PostTypeId": "1", "LastEditorUserId": "7028", "CreationDate": "2013-10-18T11:07:06.030", "LastActivityDate": "2015-06-23T20:24:48.740", "Title": "C language linkage typedef & templates", "AcceptedAnswerId": "19449007", "LastEditDate": "2015-06-23T20:24:48.740", "Id": "19448165", "Score": "1", "Body": "<p>I understand that a template cannot appear inside an <code>extern \"C\"</code> block, the reason for which is that the <em>name</em> of the instantiated template functions cannot appear once than once using an unmangled name.</p>\n<p>However, in the code below, the name of the function <em>is</em> being mangled (so there should be no problem because each instantiation will have a unique name) but still has function type with C language linkage.
