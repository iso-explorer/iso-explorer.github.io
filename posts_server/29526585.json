If the function is defined multiple times, the linker will let you know. This is good, because it avoids accidentally defining multiple functions with the same name and signature in a given program. If you want to override this, you can declare the function <code>inline</code>.

You can, and in the presented code <code>CAdd::getResult</code> is one such function.</p>\n<p>In order to support general use of a header in multiple translation units, which gives multiple competing definitions of the function, it needs to be <code>inline</code>. A function defined in the class definition, like <code>getResult</code>, is automatically <code>inline</code>. A function defined outside the class definition needs to be explicitly declared <code>inline</code>.</p>\n<p>In practical terms the <code>inline</code> specifier tells the linker to just arbitrarily select one of the definitions, if there are several.</p>\n<p>There is unfortunately no simple syntax to do the same for data. That is, data can't just be declared as <code>inline</code>. However, there is an exemption for static data members of class templates, and also an <code>inline</code> function with extern linkage can contain <code>static</code> local variables, and so compilers are required to support effectively the same mechanism also for data.</p>\n<p>An <code>inline</code> function has <code>extern</code> linkage by default. Since <code>inline</code> also serves as an optimization hint it's possible to have an <code>inline static</code> function. For the case of the default <code>extern</code> linkage, be aware that the standard then requires the function to be defined, identically, in every translation unit where it's used. </p>\n<p>The part of the standard dealing with this is called the <em>One Definition Rule</em>, usually abbreviated as the <strong>ODR</strong>.</p>\n<p>In C++11 the ODR is \u00a73.2 \u201cOne definition rule\u201d. Specifically, C++11 \u00a73.2/3 specifies the requirement about definitions of an <code>inline</code> function in every relevant translation unit. This requirement is however repeated in C+11 \u00a77.1.2/4 about \u201cFunction specifiers\u201d.</p>\n", "LastEditorUserId": "464581", "LastActivityDate": "2015-04-08T23:29:16.000", "Score": "4", "CreationDate": "2015-04-08T22:48:05.863", "ParentId": "29526585", "CommentCount": "0", "OwnerUserId": "464581", "LastEditDate": "2015-04-08T23:29:16.000"}});
