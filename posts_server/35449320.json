That is, it calls the default constructors of the bases and of the non-static members of this class.</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>And for <code>MyStruct obj{2, 2};</code>, <code>obj</code> is an automatic object, so (from standard $8.5/12 Initializers [dcl.init])</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p id=\"so_35449320_35449495_3\">If no initializer is specified for an object, the object is default-initialized. When storage for an object\n  with automatic or dynamic storage duration is obtained, the object has an <strong>indeterminate value</strong>, and if\n  no initialization is performed for the object, that object retains an indeterminate value until that value is\n  replaced (5.18).
