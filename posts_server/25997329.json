Does it mean the beginning of usage of the constructor, or the completion of usage of the constructor? In other word, there are two possible orders for the code below:</p>\n<ol>\n<li><p>BaseClass constructor starts -&gt; BaseClass constructor completes -&gt; DerivedClass constructor starts -&gt; DerivedClass constructor completes.</p></li>\n<li><p>DerivedClass constructor starts -&gt; BaseClass constructor starts -&gt; BaseClass constructor completes -&gt; DerivedClass constructor completes.</p></li>\n</ol>\n<p>Which one should be the correct order? And if 1 is correct, how does the compiler know to call BaseClass constructor before we initialize a DerivedClass instance?</p>\n<p>It seems case 2 is correct: \"called\" should mean the completion of constructor. A follow-up question is how about the destructor? I know the standard answer is \"the destructor of derived class is called first\". So which is the correct order for:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>DerivedClass destructor starts </li>\n<li>DerivedClass destructor completes</li>\n<li>BaseClass destructor starts</li>\n<li>BaseClass destructor completes</li>\n</ul>\n<p>Thanks</p>\n<pre><code>class BaseClass {\npublic:\n    BaseClass() {\n        cout &lt;&lt; \"BaseClass constructor.\" &lt;&lt; endl;\n    }\n};\n\nclass DerivedClass : public BaseClass {\npublic:\n    DerivedClass() : BaseClass() {\n        cout &lt;&lt; \"DerivedClass constructor.\" &lt;&lt; endl;\n    }\n};\n\nint main() {\n    DerivedClass dc;\n}\n</code></pre>\n", "Tags": "<c++><constructor><derived-class><base-class>", "OwnerUserId": "2705212", "AnswerCount": "2"}, "25997527": {"ParentId": "25997329", "PostTypeId": "2", "CommentCount": "2", "Body": "<p>[class.base.init]/10, emphasis mine:</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p id=\"so_25997329_25997527_0\">In a non-delegating constructor, initialization proceeds in the\n  following order:</p>\n<ul>\n<li><p id=\"so_25997329_25997527_1\">First, and only for the constructor of the most\n  derived class, virtual base classes are initialized [...]</p></li>\n<li><p id=\"so_25997329_25997527_2\">Then, <strong>direct base classes are initialized</strong> in\n  declaration order as they appear in the <em>base-specifier-list</em>\n  (regardless of the order of the <em>mem-initializers</em>).</p></li>\n<li><p id=\"so_25997329_25997527_3\">Then, non-static\n  data members are initialized in the order they were declared in the\n  class definition (again regardless of the order of the\n  <em>mem-initializers</em>).</p></li>\n<li><p id=\"so_25997329_25997527_4\"><strong>Finally, the <em>compound-statement</em> of the constructor body is executed</strong>.</p></li>\n</ul>\n</blockquote>\n<p>That is, the derived class' ctor is \"called\" first, but before its compound-statement (its function body), the base class ctor must complete.</p>\n<hr>\n<p>One way we can see this order is to use a <em>function-try-block</em> in the ctor of the derived class:</p>\n<pre><code>#include &lt;iostream&gt;\n\nstruct Base {\n    Base() { throw \"Base throwing\\n\"; }\n};\n\nstruct Derived : Base{\n    Derived()\n    try : Base()\n    {}\n    catch(char const* p) {\n        std::cout &lt;&lt; p;\n    }\n};\n\nint main() {\n    try { Derived d; }catch(...){}\n}\n</code></pre>\n<p><a href=\"http://coliru.stacked-crooked.com/a/1a3d88b5f884bbdd\" rel=\"nofollow\">Live example</a></p>\n<p>The <em>function-try-block</em> can catch exceptions that occur during the initialization of bases and members.

Therefore, the destructor itself has to invoke the destruction of bases and members (at least, for virtual destructors called via dynamic dispatch).</p>\n</hr></hr>", "OwnerUserId": "420683", "LastEditorUserId": "420683", "LastEditDate": "2014-09-23T15:16:52.580", "Id": "25997527", "Score": "5", "CreationDate": "2014-09-23T14:20:10.467", "LastActivityDate": "2014-09-23T15:16:52.580"}, "25997457": {"ParentId": "25997329", "CommentCount": "1", "Body": "<p>The correct answer is choice 1, but this can be easily verified by actually running the code you already typed out</p>\n", "OwnerUserId": "2236401", "PostTypeId": "2", "Id": "25997457", "Score": "0", "CreationDate": "2014-09-23T14:16:36.843", "LastActivityDate": "2014-09-23T14:16:36.843"}, "bq_ids": {"n4140": {"so_25997329_25997527_4": {"section_id": 438, "quality": 1.0, "length": 5}, "so_25997329_25997527_2": {"section_id": 438, "quality": 1.0, "length": 13}, "so_25997329_25997527_0": {"section_id": 438, "quality": 1.0, "length": 6}, "so_25997329_25997527_1": {"section_id": 438, "quality": 1.0, "length": 9}, "so_25997329_25997527_5": {"section_id": 404, "quality": 1.0, "length": 34}, "so_25997329_25997527_6": {"section_id": 404, "quality": 1.0, "length": 24}, "so_25997329_25997527_3": {"section_id": 438, "quality": 1.0, "length": 15}}, "n3337": {"so_25997329_25997527_4": {"section_id": 429, "quality": 1.0, "length": 5}, "so_25997329_25997527_5": {"section_id": 395, "quality": 1.0, "length": 34}, "so_25997329_25997527_0": {"section_id": 429, "quality": 1.0, "length": 6}, "so_25997329_25997527_2": {"section_id": 429, "quality": 1.0, "length": 13}, "so_25997329_25997527_1": {"section_id": 429, "quality": 1.0, "length": 9}, "so_25997329_25997527_3": {"section_id": 429, "quality": 1.0, "length": 15}, "so_25997329_25997527_6": {"section_id": 395, "quality": 1.0, "length": 24}}, "n4659": {"so_25997329_25997527_5": {"section_id": 422, "quality": 1.0, "length": 34}, "so_25997329_25997527_2": {"section_id": 458, "quality": 1.0, "length": 13}, "so_25997329_25997527_0": {"section_id": 458, "quality": 1.0, "length": 6}, "so_25997329_25997527_1": {"section_id": 458, "quality": 1.0, "length": 9}, "so_25997329_25997527_4": {"section_id": 458, "quality": 1.0, "length": 5}, "so_25997329_25997527_6": {"section_id": 422, "quality": 1.0, "length": 24}, "so_25997329_25997527_3": {"section_id": 458, "quality": 1.0, "length": 15}}}});
