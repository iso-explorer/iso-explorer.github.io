When it runs out of parameters, it will start pushing the defaults onto the stack until all required parameters are filled (I know this is a simplification, since parameters are actually pushed from right to left, so it will start with the defaults, but the idea is the same).</p>\n<p>If this is true, why can't member variables be used as defaults? It seems to me that since the compiler is pushing them as usual at the call site, it should be able to resolve them just fine!</p>\n<p><strong>EDIT</strong> Since it seems by the answers my question was misunderstood, let me clarify. I know this is the case, and I know what is and isn't allowed by the language. My question is why did the language designers choose to not allow this, since it seems to naturally work.</p>\n", "Tags": "<c++><language-lawyer><default-parameters>", "OwnerUserId": "331785", "AnswerCount": "4"}, "13679985": {"ParentId": "13678627", "PostTypeId": "2", "CommentCount": "4", "Body": "<p>The essence of what you are asking can be distilled into this simple example</p>\n<pre><code>void foo(int a, int b = a);\n</code></pre>\n<p>This is not allowed in C++. C++ does not allow default arguments to depend on other parameters.</p>\n<p>Using class members as default arguments is just a particular case of the above, since class members are accessed through <code>this</code> pointer and <code>this</code> pointer is just another hidden parameter of each non-static member function.</p>\n<p>So, the question is really why</p>\n<pre><code>void foo(int a, int b = a);\n</code></pre>\n<p>is not allowed. </p>\n<p>One obvious potential reason to disallow this is that it would impose additional requirements on the order of argument evaluation. As you know, in C++ the order of function argument evaluation is unspecified - the compiler can evaluate arguments in any order. However, in order to support the above default argument functionality the compiler would have to make sure that <code>a</code> is evaluated before <code>b</code>. This feels like an excessive requirement, which restricts the typical freedom of evaluation order that we are used to seeing in C++.</p>\n<p>Note that this</p>\n<pre><code>int a;\n\nvoid foo(int b = a);\n</code></pre>\n<p>is allowed in C++. And, obviously, it does not exhibit the aforementioned order of evaluation issue.</p>\n", "OwnerUserId": "187690", "LastEditorUserId": "187690", "LastEditDate": "2012-12-16T08:00:16.457", "Id": "13679985", "Score": "4", "CreationDate": "2012-12-03T09:03:05.343", "LastActivityDate": "2012-12-16T08:00:16.457"}, "bq_ids": {"n4140": {"so_13678627_13678627_0": {"section_id": 3260, "quality": 0.6666666666666666, "length": 6}, "so_13678627_13678730_1": {"section_id": 3260, "quality": 0.8888888888888888, "length": 16}, "so_13678627_13678730_0": {"section_id": 3258, "quality": 1.0, "length": 4}}, "n3337": {"so_13678627_13678627_0": {"section_id": 3132, "quality": 0.6666666666666666, "length": 6}, "so_13678627_13678730_1": {"section_id": 3132, "quality": 0.8888888888888888, "length": 16}, "so_13678627_13678730_0": {"section_id": 3130, "quality": 1.0, "length": 4}}, "n4659": {"so_13678627_13678627_0": {"section_id": 8595, "quality": 0.6666666666666666, "length": 6}, "so_13678627_13678730_1": {"section_id": 4018, "quality": 0.7222222222222222, "length": 13}}}, "13679880": {"ParentId": "13678627", "PostTypeId": "2", "CommentCount": "6", "Body": "<p>Summarizing Nawaz excellent answer in the linked question: The call to <code>void Foo::Bar(int a = this-&gt;member)</code> really means <code>void Foo__Bar(Foo* this, int a = this-&gt;member)</code>.
