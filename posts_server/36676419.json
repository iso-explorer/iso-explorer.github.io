In the first example, you declare a reference (<code>rx</code>) to an object which was already named before (<code>x</code>). In the second example, your three references (<code>r1</code>, <code>r2</code>, <code>r3</code>) refer to temporary objects which are created during the initialisation of each reference.</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p id=\"so_36676419_36676551_1\">So why these references behave like objects, they do have values ,\n  memory address and size ...</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>They don't.
