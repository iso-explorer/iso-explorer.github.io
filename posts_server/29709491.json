Your code is subject to undefined behavior.

In the first alternative (<em>delete object</em>), the value of the operand of <code>delete</code> may be a null pointer value, a pointer to a non-array object created by a previous <em>new-expression</em>, or a pointer to a subobject (1.8) representing a base class of such an object (Clause 10). If not, the behavior is undefined.</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>In your case, <code>pFoo_heap</code> was not created by a <em>new-expression</em>, <code>buf_heap</code> was created by a <em>new-expression</em>.
