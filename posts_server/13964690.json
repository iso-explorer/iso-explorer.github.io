Neither should you consider the implementation to be anything specific. In short, the language standard treats reference implementation as an detail which user of the language does not need to know and hence it abstracts this detail.</p>\n", "LastEditorUserId": "452307", "LastActivityDate": "2012-12-20T03:47:20.257", "Score": "17", "CreationDate": "2012-12-20T03:09:45.353", "ParentId": "13964690", "CommentCount": "4", "OwnerUserId": "452307", "LastEditDate": "2012-12-20T03:47:20.257"}, "bq_ids": {"n4140": {"so_13964690_13964709_1": {"length": 5, "quality": 1.0, "section_id": 3221}}, "n3337": {"so_13964690_13964709_1": {"length": 5, "quality": 1.0, "section_id": 3095}}, "n4659": {"so_13964690_13964709_1": {"length": 5, "quality": 1.0, "section_id": 3978}}}, "13964690": {"ViewCount": "1862", "Body": "<p>I was wondering why this question wasn't discussed in stack overflow?\nreference is just an other name to variable so how does execution happen at memory level</p>\n<p>are references implemented as pointers inside?</p>\n", "AcceptedAnswerId": "13964709", "Title": "size of reference variable in c++", "CreationDate": "2012-12-20T03:08:02.887", "LastActivityDate": "2012-12-20T03:47:20.257", "CommentCount": "2", "FavoriteCount": "1", "PostTypeId": "1", "Tags": "<c++>", "Id": "13964690", "Score": "5", "OwnerUserId": "411196", "ClosedDate": "2012-12-20T08:24:04.190", "AnswerCount": "1"}});
