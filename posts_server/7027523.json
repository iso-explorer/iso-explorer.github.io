That suggests that whilst the object might not be capable of doing much anymore, all of its member functions should still exhibit defined behaviour \u2014 including <code>operator=</code> \u2014 and all its members in a defined state- and it still requires destruction. The Standard gives no specific definitions because it would be unique to each UDT, but you might be able to find specifications for Standard types. Some like containers are relatively obvious \u2014 they just move their contents around and an empty container is a well-defined valid state. Primitives don't modify the moved-from object.</p>\n<p>Side note: I believe it's <code>T c = std::move(a)</code> so that if the move constructor (or copy constructor if no move is provided) is explicit the function will fail.</p>\n", "OwnerUserId": "298661", "LastEditorUserId": "658087", "LastEditDate": "2016-03-26T09:09:59.843", "Id": "7027695", "Score": "43", "CreationDate": "2011-08-11T14:30:45.773", "LastActivityDate": "2016-03-26T09:09:59.843"}, "7027523": {"CommentCount": "1", "AcceptedAnswerId": "7027695", "CreationDate": "2011-08-11T14:19:12.767", "LastActivityDate": "2016-10-25T14:40:01.013", "PostTypeId": "1", "ViewCount": "7027", "FavoriteCount": "23", "Title": "What can I do with a moved-from object?", "Id": "7027523", "Score": "104", "Body": "<p>Does the standard define precisely what I can do with an object once it has been moved from?
