If you ignore virtual bases and constructor delegation, and consider instantiation of a class T, then when you instantiate T the first that happens is that a T constructor is called. But this is not yet initialization of the T instance itself. The execution is still in the memory initializer list of that constructor. Here it calls the various base and non-base member constructors (where the same happens, recursively). Finally the constructor body is executed.</p>\n</hr></hr>", "OwnerUserId": "464581", "LastEditorUserId": "464581", "LastEditDate": "2014-06-18T10:22:22.473", "Id": "24281583", "Score": "2", "CreationDate": "2014-06-18T09:13:51.573", "LastActivityDate": "2014-06-18T10:22:22.473"}, "24281500": {"CommentCount": "5", "ViewCount": "94", "CreationDate": "2014-06-18T09:09:55.490", "LastActivityDate": "2014-06-18T10:22:22.473", "Title": "How derived class constructor calls base class constructor internally", "AcceptedAnswerId": "24281583", "PostTypeId": "1", "Id": "24281500", "Score": "0", "Body": "<pre><code>#include &lt;iostream&gt;\n#include &lt;string&gt;\nusing namespace std;\n\nclass A\n{\n    private:\n        int ai;\n        string as;\n};\nclass B : public A\n{\n    private:\n        int bi;\n        string bs;\n};\n\n\nint main()\n{\n    B bob;\n\n    return 0;\n}\n</code></pre>\n<p>Class A and B have default constructors.
