The idea is that the function body is probably small and calling the function is more overhead than the body of the function itself.</p>\n<p>To be able to do this the compiler needs to see the definition while compiling the code, where the function is being called. Usually, this is done by adding the definition of the function in an header with the <code>inline</code> specifier and then including the header file in every cpp file where the function is to be called.</p>\n", "LastEditorUserId": "-1", "LastActivityDate": "2012-03-24T17:16:36.480", "Score": "5", "CreationDate": "2012-03-24T16:26:36.570", "ParentId": "9853318", "CommentCount": "3", "OwnerUserId": "452307", "LastEditDate": "2017-05-23T12:15:10.500"}, "9853346": {"Id": "9853346", "PostTypeId": "2", "Body": "<p>The statement makes no sense: a function that is inlined is no longer called, the code is simply there in the current function (it has been \"inlined\").
