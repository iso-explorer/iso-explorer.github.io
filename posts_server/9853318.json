Usually, this is done by adding the definition of the function in an header with the <code>inline</code> specifier and then including the header file in every cpp file where the function is to be called.</p>\n", "OwnerUserId": "452307", "LastEditorUserId": "-1", "LastEditDate": "2017-05-23T12:15:10.500", "Id": "9853337", "Score": "5", "CreationDate": "2012-03-24T16:26:36.570", "LastActivityDate": "2012-03-24T17:16:36.480"}});
