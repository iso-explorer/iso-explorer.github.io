It seems like I'm doing the try-catch's exactly the same! The only difference is that in the first case I'm throwing an int, then a general exception, but in the second case, I'm throwing a general exception both times. Is the program confused as to which catch to go to?</p>\n", "Tags": "<c++><exception><try-catch>", "OwnerUserId": "861183", "AnswerCount": "2"}, "8237975": {"ParentId": "8237909", "CommentCount": "1", "Body": "<p>There's no such thing as \"general exception\" and you throw no such thing.</p>\n<p>In the first example, you throw an <code>int</code>, then you <strong>re-throw the exception that you are handling</strong>.
