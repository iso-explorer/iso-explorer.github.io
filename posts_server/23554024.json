But why? I know that <code>short</code>, <code>long</code>, and <code>long long</code> have definite sizes pretty much, but <code>int</code> seems like it might be <code>short</code> or <code>long</code> depending on the system. So, why don't people be more specific about the types? If they put a number into an <code>int</code> that is too big for a <code>short</code>, then on certain systems it will be really bad. If the number you're putting into an <code>int</code> is small enough to fit into a <code>short</code>, then on systems where it defaults to <code>long</code> memory space is wasted. So why does everybody use <code>int</code>?</p>\n", "Tags": "<c++><types><int><long-integer><short>", "OwnerUserId": "1233320", "AnswerCount": "2"}, "bq_ids": {"n4140": {"so_23554024_23554066_0": {"section_id": 7211, "quality": 1.0, "length": 17}}, "n3337": {"so_23554024_23554066_0": {"section_id": 6955, "quality": 1.0, "length": 17}}, "n4659": {"so_23554024_23554066_0": {"section_id": 8720, "quality": 1.0, "length": 17}}}, "23554066": {"ParentId": "23554024", "CommentCount": "2", "Body": "<p>According to the standard (C++11, \u00a73.9.1/2),</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p id=\"so_23554024_23554066_0\">Plain <code>int</code>s have the natural size suggested by the\n  architecture of the execution environment; the other signed integer types are provided to meet special\n  needs.</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>So <code>int</code> is the type you should use unless you have a good reason to use any other type, because <code>int</code> is supposed to map to the type that the architecture is optimized to use most of the time.</p>\n", "OwnerUserId": "481267", "PostTypeId": "2", "Id": "23554066", "Score": "14", "CreationDate": "2014-05-08T23:04:52.280", "LastActivityDate": "2014-05-08T23:04:52.280"}});
