I know that <code>short</code>, <code>long</code>, and <code>long long</code> have definite sizes pretty much, but <code>int</code> seems like it might be <code>short</code> or <code>long</code> depending on the system. So, why don't people be more specific about the types? If they put a number into an <code>int</code> that is too big for a <code>short</code>, then on certain systems it will be really bad. If the number you're putting into an <code>int</code> is small enough to fit into a <code>short</code>, then on systems where it defaults to <code>long</code> memory space is wasted.
