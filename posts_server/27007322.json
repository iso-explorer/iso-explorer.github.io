And I think most style guides would agree that the <code>static_cast</code> is preferred (as making casts explicit and noticeable is usually a good thing).</p>\n<p>In more detail:</p>\n<p>According to 4.9.1:</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p id=\"so_27007322_27007359_0\">A prvalue of a floating point type can be converted to a prvalue of an integer type. The conversion trun- cates; that is, the fractional part is discarded. The behavior is undefined if the truncated value cannot be represented in the destination type.</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>I'm not sure exactly how the const-away works in C++14, but I believe it's not a qualification conversion, but part of the lvalue-to-rvalue conversion from 4.1.1:</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p id=\"so_27007322_27007359_1\">A glvalue (3.10) of a non-function, non-array type T can be converted to a prvalue \u2026\u00a0If T is a non-class type, the type of the prvalue is the cv-unqualified version of T.</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>So, <code>f</code> has one lvalue-to-rvalue conversion from lvalue <code>const float</code> to rvalue <code>float</code>, then one floating-integral conversion from <code>float</code> to <code>unsigned int</code>, so by 4.0.1 it's a standard conversion, so by 5.2.9 it's valid as a <code>static_cast</code>.</p>\n", "LastActivityDate": "2014-11-19T01:39:50.860"}, "bq_ids": {"n4140": {"so_27007322_27007359_0": {"section_id": 37, "quality": 0.84, "length": 21}, "so_27007322_27007359_1": {"section_id": 8, "quality": 0.9285714285714286, "length": 13}}, "n3337": {"so_27007322_27007359_0": {"section_id": 34, "quality": 0.84, "length": 21}, "so_27007322_27007359_1": {"section_id": 5, "quality": 0.9285714285714286, "length": 13}}, "n4659": {"so_27007322_27007359_0": {"section_id": 37, "quality": 0.76, "length": 19}, "so_27007322_27007359_1": {"section_id": 8, "quality": 0.9285714285714286, "length": 13}}}});
