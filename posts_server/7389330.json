With references you cannot do this, so you use pointers to do it inexpensively.</p>\n", "OwnerUserId": "726361", "LastEditorUserId": "726361", "LastEditDate": "2011-09-12T14:38:40.423", "Id": "7389383", "Score": "7", "CreationDate": "2011-09-12T14:21:56.117", "LastActivityDate": "2011-09-12T14:38:40.423"}, "7389330": {"CommentCount": "4", "ViewCount": "157", "PostTypeId": "1", "LastEditorUserId": "992687", "CreationDate": "2011-09-12T14:17:54.877", "LastActivityDate": "2012-10-28T20:36:23.483", "Title": "Why cant we use reference in algorithms and data structure?", "AcceptedAnswerId": "7389383", "LastEditDate": "2012-10-28T20:36:23.483", "Id": "7389330", "Score": "4", "Body": "<blockquote>\n<p id=\"so_7389330_7389330_0\">As a general rule, use references in function parameters and return\n  types to define attractive interfaces.
