While that covers most common synchronization primitives, useful\nproperties can be obtained by building consistent models on weaker\nguarantees.</p>\n<p>The biggest example is the <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Seqlock\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">seqlock</a>.\nIt relies on \"speculatively\" reading data that may not be in a\nconsistent state. Because reads are allowed to race with writes,\nreaders don't block writers -- a property which is used in the Linux\nkernel to allow the system clock to be updated even if a user process\nis repeatedly reading it. Another strength of the seqlock is that on\nmodern SMP arches it scales perfectly with the number of readers:\nbecause the readers don't need to take any locks, they only need\nshared access to the cache lines.</p>\n<p>The ideal implementation of a seqlock would use something like a\n\"release load\" in the reader, which is not available in any major\nprogramming language.
