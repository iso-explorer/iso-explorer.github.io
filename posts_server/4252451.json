It appears to be a bug in the C++ Standard. In these cases, compile writers have to make up their mind on what is most viable. If you remove the example in question, then 3.3/4 states the example is valid: \"Given a set of declarations in a single declarative region, each of which specifies the same unqualified name, ... they shall all refer to the same entity, or all refer to functions and function templates; or ...\". </p>\n<p>The question arises, as discussed in the linked issue, what 7.3.3/8 refers to when it says \"declarations\", which the committee didn't reach consensus about. And so, until then 3.3/4 applies for GCC/VS2010 and Clang, while Comeau chooses to use some other semantics.</p>\n", "LastActivityDate": "2010-11-23T23:42:16.090"}});
