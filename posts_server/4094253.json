When you declare a <code>struct</code> in C, the tag name is just that, a tag name.  To be able to use it in a standalone way, you need a <code>typedef</code>.  In C++ you don't need the typedef, that makes live easier.  But C++ rules have been complicated by the need to be able to import already existing C headers which \"overloaded\" the tag name with a function name.  The canonical example of that is the Unix <code>stat()</code> function which uses a <code>struct stat*</code> as argument.</p>\n<p>Q3: Standard reading is usually quite difficult... you need to already know that there is no place elsewhere modifying what you are reading.  It isn't strange that people knowing how to do that are language lawyer...</p>\n", "LastActivityDate": "2010-11-04T06:43:08.247", "CommentCount": "0", "CreationDate": "2010-11-04T06:43:08.247", "ParentId": "4094253", "Score": "1", "OwnerUserId": "136208"}, "4094253": {"ViewCount": "595", "Body": "<blockquote>\n<p id=\"so_4094253_4094253_0\">$10.2/4- \"[ Note: Looking up a name in\n  an elaborated-type-specifier (3.4.4)\n  or base-specifier (Clause 10), for\n  instance, ignores all nontype\n  declarations, while looking up a name\n  in a nested-name-specifier (3.4.3)\n  ignores function, variable, and\n  enumerator declarations.\"</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>I have found this statement to be very confusing in this section while describing about name lookup.</p>\n<pre><code>void S(){}\n\nstruct S{\n   S(){cout &lt;&lt; 1;}\n   void f(){}\n   static const int x = 0;\n}; \n\nint main(){ \n   struct S *p = new struct ::S;  // here ::S refers to type\n   p-&gt;::S::f();\n\n   S::x;  // base specifier, ignores the function declaration 'S'\n\n   ::S(); // nested name specifier, ignores the struct declaration 'S'.\n   delete p;\n} \n</code></pre>\n<p>My questions: </p>\n<ol>\n<li><p>Is my understanding of the rules correct? </p></li>\n<li><p>Why <code>::S</code> on the line doing new treated automatically to mean struct <code>S</code>, whereas in the last line <code>::S</code> means the functions <code>S</code> in the global namespace. </p></li>\n<li><p>Does this point to an ambiguity in the documentation, or is it yet another day for me to stay away from C++ Standard document?</p></li>\n</ol>\n", "AcceptedAnswerId": "4094438", "Title": "Name lookup Clarification", "CreationDate": "2010-11-04T06:01:24.353", "Id": "4094253", "CommentCount": "3", "FavoriteCount": "1", "PostTypeId": "1", "LastEditDate": "2011-10-02T10:47:37.983", "LastEditorUserId": "34509", "LastActivityDate": "2011-10-02T10:47:37.983", "Score": "2", "OwnerUserId": "418110", "Tags": "<c++><c++11><name-lookup>", "AnswerCount": "2"}});
