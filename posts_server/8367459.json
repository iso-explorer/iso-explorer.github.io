See this site <a href=\"http://www.gotw.ca/gotw/066.htm\" rel=\"nofollow\">http://www.gotw.ca/gotw/066.htm</a> from where I've extracted the following text, regarding <code>function-try-blocks</code> :</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p id=\"so_8367459_8367459_0\"><strong>Toward Some Morals</strong> </p>\n<p id=\"so_8367459_8367459_1\">Incidentally, this also means that the only (repeat\n  only) possible use for a constructor function-try-block is to\n  translate an exception thrown from a base or member subobject. That's\n  Moral #1. Next, Moral #2 says that destructor function-try-blocks are\n  entirely usele--</p>\n<p id=\"so_8367459_8367459_2\">\"--But wait!\" I hear someone interrupting from the middle of the room.\n  \"I don't agree with Moral #1. I can think of another possible use for\n  constructor function-try-blocks, namely to free resources allocated in\n  the initializer list or in the constructor body!\"</p>\n<p id=\"so_8367459_8367459_3\">Sorry, nope. After all, remember that once you get into your\n  constructor try-block's handler, any local variables in the\n  constructor body are also already out of scope, and you are guaranteed\n  that no base subobjects or member objects exist any more, period. You\n  can't even refer to their names. Either the parts of your object were\n  never constructed, or those that were constructed have already been\n  destroyed. So you can't be cleaning up anything that relies on\n  referring to a base or member of the class (and anyway, that's what\n  the base and member destructors are for, right?).</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>Assuming this quote, the following code should not compile, as the object <code>cat</code> has already been destructed by the time the process runs into the <code>catch</code> clause.
