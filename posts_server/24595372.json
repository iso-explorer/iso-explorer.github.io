If your program doesn't start any threads, then all initializations happen in some (possibly indeterminate) sequence.</p>\n<hr>\n<p>There are no constraints beyond the constraints described in the Standard<sup>1</sup> on which threads perform initialization and destruction of objects with static storage duration. In particular, the initialization of objects in different translation units are indeterminately sequenced with respect to one another (cf. [basic.start.init]/2), and <em>unsequenced</em> if the program starts threads.</p>\n<p>It is therefore possible for initializations to occur concurrently in multiple threads if the first function call within a TU occurs within another thread other than the main thread. What the standard says is that those objects whose initialization <em>is</em> sequenced (e.g. those in the same TU) are also destroyed in a deterministic, compatible order.</p>\n<p><sub><strong>______________</strong><br>\n1) \"beyond what is said, nothing is said\" \u2014 a bit it of a tautology, but worth calling out</br></sub></p>\n</hr>", "LastActivityDate": "2014-07-06T13:44:47.247"}, "bq_ids": {"n4140": {"so_24595372_24595372_0": {"section_id": 7156, "quality": 0.8518518518518519, "length": 23}}, "n3337": {"so_24595372_24595372_0": {"section_id": 6900, "quality": 0.8518518518518519, "length": 23}}, "n4659": {"so_24595372_24595372_0": {"section_id": 8663, "quality": 0.7407407407407407, "length": 20}}}});
