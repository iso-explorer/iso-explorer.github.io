The point of this was so that I could simply std::cout &lt;&lt; the chars that were being pointed to. Something like this:</p>\n<pre><code>int main(){\n    char a = 'a';\n    char b = 'b';\n    char *&amp; word = ???;\n    char[0] = &amp;a;\n}\n</code></pre>\n<p>I ended up realizing I could do the inverse:</p>\n<pre><code>int main(){\n    char * a;\n    char * b;\n    char * word = new char[2];\n    word[0] = 'a';\n    word[1] = 'b';\n    a = &amp;word[0];\n    b = &amp;word[1];\n    *a = 'c';\n    std::cout &lt;&lt; word &lt;&lt; \"\\n\";\n}\n</code></pre>\n<p>So, problem solved.
