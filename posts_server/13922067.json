As a job interview question I was asked for a situation where you do not declare a constructor but still do not get an implicit default constructor either. So you end up with a class without any constructors. It is supposed to be code that compiles, so the answer is not having a member variable that does itself not provide a default constructor. Any ideas? Searching through stack overflow and various C++ sites did not reveal anything. Also, as a hint the interviewer said it does not have to do with inheritance.</p>\n", "Tags": "<c++>", "OwnerUserId": "1245772", "AnswerCount": "3"}, "13922401": {"ParentId": "13922067", "CommentCount": "2", "Body": "<p>No, there is no such trick, unless it's a catch in the exact wording of the question.</p>\n<p>12.1p5:</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p id=\"so_13922067_13922401_0\">If there is no user-declared constructor for class <code>X</code>, a constructor having no parameters is implicitly declared as defaulted.</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>The implicitly declared default constructor might be defined as deleted, but it is still a member of the class.</p>\n", "OwnerUserId": "459640", "PostTypeId": "2", "Id": "13922401", "Score": "0", "CreationDate": "2012-12-17T21:22:42.217", "LastActivityDate": "2012-12-17T21:22:42.217"}, "13922569": {"ParentId": "13922067", "CommentCount": "0", "Body": "<p>Effective C++, Item 5: \"These functions [ctor, dtor, copy ctor, copy assignment operator] are generated only if they are needed [...]\"</p>\n<p>According to that, if you have a class that has no declared ctors, and you do not create any instances of that class, then your class will have no constructor(s) at all.</p>\n", "OwnerUserId": "1901983", "PostTypeId": "2", "Id": "13922569", "Score": "0", "CreationDate": "2012-12-17T21:35:38.930", "LastActivityDate": "2012-12-17T21:35:38.930"}, "bq_ids": {"n4140": {"so_13922067_13922235_1": {"section_id": 369, "quality": 0.8333333333333334, "length": 5}, "so_13922067_13922401_0": {"section_id": 369, "quality": 1.0, "length": 10}, "so_13922067_13922235_0": {"section_id": 370, "quality": 0.8095238095238095, "length": 17}}, "n3337": {"so_13922067_13922235_1": {"section_id": 359, "quality": 0.8333333333333334, "length": 5}, "so_13922067_13922401_0": {"section_id": 359, "quality": 1.0, "length": 10}, "so_13922067_13922235_0": {"section_id": 360, "quality": 0.8095238095238095, "length": 17}}, "n4659": {"so_13922067_13922401_0": {"section_id": 381, "quality": 1.0, "length": 10}, "so_13922067_13922235_1": {"section_id": 382, "quality": 0.8333333333333334, "length": 5}, "so_13922067_13922235_0": {"section_id": 384, "quality": 0.8095238095238095, "length": 17}}}});
