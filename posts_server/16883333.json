A class <em>declaration</em> can be a forward declaration, such as:</p>\n<pre><code>class X;\n</code></pre>\n<p>This just makes the compiler aware of the existence of that class, but does not specify what members the class has, what base classes, and so on (that's what a class <em>definition</em> does). </p>\n<p>However, a declaration can also be a <em>definition</em>, such as:</p>\n<pre><code>class X\n{\n    // ...\n};\n</code></pre>\n<p>So in a sense, since a definition is also a declaration, the sentence is not wrong. </p>\n<p>The sentence would be wrong under the common-sense assumption that by <em>declaration</em> we mean a <em>declaration which is not a definition</em>, but when dealing with such terms it is probably better to keep in mind their formal definition.</p>\n", "LastEditorUserId": "1932150", "LastActivityDate": "2013-06-02T14:31:31.550", "Score": "7", "CreationDate": "2013-06-02T13:45:37.227", "ParentId": "16883333", "CommentCount": "4", "OwnerUserId": "1932150", "LastEditDate": "2013-06-02T14:31:31.550"}});
