If this were the case, wouldn't <code>A::a</code> be a potential result of <code>A::a[0]</code>?</p>\n<p>And then, we would conclude that <code>A::a</code> is not <em>odr-used</em> by <code>A::a[0]</code> in the initialization <code>int a = A::a[0];</code>, by [basic.def.odr]/3, which is exactly the opposite of what the OP said in his answer.</p>\n<p>What am I missing?</p>\n<p><strong>Edit</strong> When I mention above the second bullet point in [basic.def.odr]/2, I'm referring to the draft N4618. This bullet point was not present in the draft N3936 referred to by the OP. So it seems to me, that according to N3936 <code>A::a</code> was odr-used by <code>A::a[0]</code>, but it is not by N4618. Am I correct?</p>\n", "Tags": "<c++><language-lawyer><one-definition-rule>", "OwnerUserId": "4463557", "AnswerCount": "0"}, "bq_ids": {"n4140": {"so_42725415_42725415_0": {"section_id": 7040, "quality": 0.5555555555555556, "length": 5}}, "n4659": {"so_42725415_42725415_0": {"section_id": 8537, "quality": 0.5555555555555556, "length": 5}}}});
