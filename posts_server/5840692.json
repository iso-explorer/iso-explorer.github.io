If the expression has class type this involves the copy (or move) constructor and the constructor must be accessible at the point of the <code>throw</code>. If the copy constructor of an exception object is private then that object could only be thrown from a member function or a friend function.</p>\n<p>This concern is completely independent of whether the exception object is subsequently caught by value or by reference later in the program.</p>\n<p>In constructing the temporary exception object, the actual copy may be elided but C++ requires that the constructor that would have been used still be accessible.</p>\n<p>ISO/IEC 14882:2003 15.1 [except.throw] / 5:</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p id=\"so_5840692_5840934_0\">If the use of the temporary object can be eliminated without changing the meaning of the program except for the execution of constructors and destructors associated with the use of the temporary object (12.2), then the exception in the handler can be initialized directly with the argument of the throw expression. When the thrown object is a class object, and the copy constructor used to initialize the temporary copy is not accessible, the program is ill-formed (even when the temporary object could otherwise be eliminated).\n  Similarly, if the destructor for that object is not accessible, the program is ill-formed (even when the temporary object could otherwise be eliminated).</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>This requirement has not been removed in C++0x although the throw expression may now be moved instead of copied where appropriate.</p>\n<p>Draft n3291 15.1 [except.throw] / 5:</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p id=\"so_5840692_5840934_1\">When the thrown object is a class object, the copy/move constructor and the destructor shall be accessible, even if the copy/move operation is elided (12.8).</p>\n</blockquote>\n", "OwnerUserId": "19563", "LastEditorUserId": "19563", "LastEditDate": "2011-04-30T09:56:29.387", "Id": "5840934", "Score": "5", "CreationDate": "2011-04-30T09:51:01.700", "LastActivityDate": "2011-04-30T09:56:29.387"}, "5840749": {"ParentId": "5840692", "CommentCount": "0", "Body": "<p>When you catch the exception using reference (&amp; symbol) you will get the same exception object that was generated i.e the variable in the catch block will be pointing to same exception object in memory that was thrown and hence no need to have a copy cons.
