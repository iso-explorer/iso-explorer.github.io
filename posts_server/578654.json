So strictly speaking (see <a href=\"http://www.open-std.org/jtc1/sc22/wg21/docs/cwg_defects.html#454\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">this report</a>), only the c++1x solution provides really guarantee that in obvious cases also like <code>\"s == string::npos\"</code> where an integral constant is not <em>required</em> the definition of the static member is not needed, because the next Standard has a different, better wording of 3.2. This is however quite theoretical stuff, since most (all?) compiler don't moan anyway.
