I think we can take this to mean that the comparator induces a strict weak ordering on <code>Key</code> objects <em>which are elements of the container</em>, not necessarily on all objects of type <code>Key</code>. For instance if the Key is a pointer then I'm pretty sure it's fine to write a comparator that dereferences it, provided you don't use a null pointer as a key. By the same reasoning, I hope we can modify a key which isn't in the container.</p>\n<p>[*] by \"modify\", I mean do anything which changes the results of the comparator with that key and some other key. In this case of course you aren't really modifying the key itself (which is just a pointer value), but that's what I'm calling it.</p>\n", "OwnerUserId": "13005", "PostTypeId": "2", "Id": "3641623", "Score": "1", "CreationDate": "2010-09-04T09:22:12.023", "LastActivityDate": "2010-09-04T09:22:12.023"}, "3638438": {"ParentId": "3638406", "CommentCount": "0", "Body": "<p>The usual is to remove, update, and re-insert.
