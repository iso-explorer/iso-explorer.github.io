However, <code>NULL</code> must have integral type (4.10/1 and 18.1/4 in C++03) anyway so it's moot. <code>NULL</code> may very well be a macro that expands to <code>0</code> or <code>0UL</code>.</p>\n<p>Some modern compilers will at least warn you if it was actually <code>NULL</code> you wrote, though.</p>\n<hr>\n<blockquote>\n<p id=\"so_13212901_13212950_3\">And that it is encouraged by some to use 0 instead of NULL for pointers because it is more convenient for portability.

Though I can see where it's coming from, since <code>NULL</code>'s exact definition varies across implementations, using <code>NULL</code> will make it <em>much</em> easier to replace with <code>nullptr</code> when you switch to C++11, and if nothing else is self-documenting.</p>\n</hr></hr></hr>", "OwnerUserId": "560648", "LastEditorUserId": "560648", "LastEditDate": "2012-11-04T00:30:25.233", "Id": "13212950", "Score": "11", "CreationDate": "2012-11-03T19:59:38.053", "LastActivityDate": "2012-11-04T00:30:25.233"}, "13212912": {"ParentId": "13212901", "PostTypeId": "2", "CommentCount": "0", "Body": "<p>It works like a void function, where the return will simply exit the function and return nothing at all.
