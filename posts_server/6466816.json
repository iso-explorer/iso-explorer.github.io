It's just because of how things work internally. A more sensible error message might be on the line where you attempted to <code>delete</code> a <code>virtual</code> function member, saying \"this is not going to work. it's going to cause problems because this implementation <em>must</em> exist.\"</p>\n<p>It doesn't make sense to <code>delete</code> an interface function anyway. Inheritance adds functionality; it does not take it away. Notice how making a member function <em>pure</em> virtual prohibits the entire class from being instantiated: derived classes must re-implement the functionality so that it is not lost.</p>\n", "LastActivityDate": "2011-06-24T11:11:48.427", "CommentCount": "4", "CreationDate": "2011-06-24T11:11:48.427", "ParentId": "6466816", "Score": "3", "OwnerUserId": "560648"}, "6466857": {"Id": "6466857", "PostTypeId": "2", "Body": "<p>Maybe you should not derive from a class that REQUIRES something if your derived class cannot implement it.
