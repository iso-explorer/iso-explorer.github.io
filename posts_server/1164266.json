Clearly arrays of refs are outright illegal, but IMHO the reason why is not so simple as saying 'they are not objects' or 'they have no size'. I'd point out that arrays themselves are not full-fledged objects in C/C++ - if you object to that, try instantiating some stl template classes using an array as a 'class' template parameter, and see what happens. You can't return them, assign them, pass them as parameters. ( an array param is treated as a pointer). But it is legal to make arrays of arrays.\nReferences do have a size that the compiler can and must calculate - you can't sizeof() a reference, but you can make a struct containing nothing but references. It will have a size sufficient to contain all the pointers which implement the references. You can't instantiate such a struct without initializing all the members:</p>\n<pre><code>struct mys {\n int &amp; a;\n int &amp; b;\n int &amp; c;\n};\n...\nint ivar1, ivar2, arr[200];\nmys my_refs = { ivar1, ivar2, arr[12] };\n\nmy_refs.a += 3  ;  // add 3 to ivar1\n</code></pre>\n<p>In fact you can add this line to the struct definition</p>\n<pre><code>struct mys {\n ...\n int &amp; operator[]( int i ) { return i==0?a : i==1? b : c; }\n};\n</code></pre>\n<p>...and now I have something which looks a LOT like an array of refs:</p>\n<pre><code>int ivar1, ivar2, arr[200];\nmys my_refs = { ivar1, ivar2, arr[12] };\n\nmy_refs[1] = my_refs[2]  ;  // copy arr[12] to ivar2\n&amp;my_refs[0];               // gives &amp;my_refs.a == &amp;ivar1\n</code></pre>\n<p>Now, this is not a real array, it's an operator overload; it won't do things that arrays normally do like sizeof(arr)/sizeof(arr[0]), for instance. But it does exactly what I want an array of references to do, with perfectly legal C++.\nExcept (a) it's a pain to set up for more than 3 or 4 elements, and (b) it's doing a calculation using a bunch of ?: which could be done using indexing (not with normal C-pointer-calculation-semantics indexing, but indexing nonetheless). I'd like to see a very limited 'array of reference' type which can actually do this. I.e. an array of references would not be treated as a general array of things which are references, but rather it would be a new 'array-of-reference' thing which effectively maps to an internally generated class similar to the one above (but which you unfortunately <em>can't</em> make with templates).</p>\n<p>this would probably work, if you don't mind this kind of nasty: recast '*this' as an array of int *'s and return a reference made from one: (not recommended, but it shows how the proper 'array' would work):</p>\n<pre><code> int &amp; operator[]( int i ) { return *(reinterpret_cast&lt;int**&gt;(this)[i]); }\n</code></pre>\n", "LastActivityDate": "2011-11-11T00:39:32.457", "CommentCount": "6", "CreationDate": "2011-11-11T00:39:32.457", "ParentId": "1164266", "Score": "21", "OwnerUserId": "450000"}, "1164266": {"ViewCount": "60341", "Body": "<p>The following code does not compile.</p>\n<pre><code>int a = 1, b = 2, c = 3;\nint&amp; arr[] = {a,b,c,8};\n</code></pre>\n<p><strong>What does the C++ standard say about this?</strong></p>\n<p>I know I could declare a class that contains a reference, then create an array of that class, as shown below.
