It is hinted at in the part of the spec that allows it. From N3337, section 5.2.7, paragraph 7:</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p id=\"so_9475267_9475371_0\">If T is \u201cpointer to cv void,\u201d then the result is a pointer to the most derived object pointed to by v.</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>So a <code>dynamic_cast&lt;void*&gt;(...)</code> is really shorthand for <code>static_cast&lt;void*&gt;(dynamic_cast&lt;MostDerivedType*&gt;(...))</code>. And that would be useful... sort of.</p>\n<p>The difficulty in making it useful is that you don't necessarily know what <code>MostDerivedType</code> is. After all, it can be different for each expression. So once you have it as a <code>void*</code>, you don't necessarily have a way to cast it back <em>safely</em>. If you make a guess about <code>MostDerivedType</code> and just <code>static_cast</code> it, and you're <em>wrong</em>, then you're in undefined behavior land. Whereas if you do the <code>dynamic_cast</code> to that type (then <code>static_cast</code> to <code>void*</code>), it will at least return NULL if it isn't of that type.</p>\n<p>So no, I would say that it isn't very useful. Not if you want to live within the boundaries of C++ and not rely on potentially undefined behavior.</p>\n", "LastActivityDate": "2012-02-28T02:05:40.913", "Score": "5", "CreationDate": "2012-02-28T02:05:40.913", "ParentId": "9475267", "CommentCount": "5", "OwnerUserId": "734069"}, "9478134": {"Id": "9478134", "PostTypeId": "2", "Body": "<p>First, when using <code>dynamic_cast&lt;void*&gt;(x)</code> you get a pointer to the first byte of the <em>most derived</em> object.
