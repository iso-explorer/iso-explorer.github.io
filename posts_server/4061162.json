The C++ language\n  will not let you define an operator\n  all of whose operands / parameters are\n  of primitive types.</p>\n<p id=\"so_4061162_4061201_1\">For example, you can't define an\n  operator== that takes two char*s and\n  uses string comparison. That's good\n  news because if s1 and s2 are of type\n  char*, the expression s1 == s2 already\n  has a well defined meaning: it\n  compares the two pointers, not the two\n  strings pointed to by those pointers.\n  You shouldn't use pointers anyway. Use\n  std::string instead of char*.</p>\n<p id=\"so_4061162_4061201_2\">If C++ let you redefine the meaning of\n  operators on built-in types, you\n  wouldn't ever know what 1 + 1 is: it\n  would depend on which headers got\n  included and whether one of those\n  headers redefined addition to mean,\n  for example, subtraction.</p>\n</blockquote>\n<h2>C++ Standard \u00a713.5.6</h2>\n<blockquote>\n<p id=\"so_4061162_4061201_3\">An operator function shall either be a non-static member function or be a non-member function and have at least one parameter whose type is a class, a reference to a class, an enumeration, or a reference to an enumeration. It is not possible to change the precedence, grouping, or number of operands of operators. The meaning of the operators =, (unary) &amp;, and , (comma), predefined for each type, can be changed for specific class and enumeration types by defining operator functions that implement these operators. Operator functions are inherited in the same manner as other base class functions.</p>\n</blockquote>\n", "LastEditorUserId": "243613", "LastActivityDate": "2010-10-31T00:02:27.637", "Score": "2", "CreationDate": "2010-10-30T23:53:10.463", "ParentId": "4061162", "CommentCount": "5", "OwnerUserId": "243613", "LastEditDate": "2010-10-31T00:02:27.637"}, "4061162": {"ViewCount": "3055", "Body": "<pre><code>int a, b, c; \n\n//do stuff.
